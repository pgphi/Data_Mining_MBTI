### About this Project

#### Motivation
The purpose of this project is, to classify the MBTI 16 personality types based on a given text input.
   
    i.e. "This evening i will enjoy myself at home drinking a cup of tea" --> "INFP"
    
![User Interface](https://github.com/pgphi/Data_Mining_MBTI/blob/main/img/ui.png)
    
#### Problem
In order to classify the different personality types, we use a multi-classification approach. Furthermore,
we use the following paradigms for solving the multi-classification problem:

##### Models for Classification

1) Naive Bayes Model (**Baseline**)
2) Decision Trees	Random Forest	
3) Logistic Regression	
4) LVM
5) kNN
6) Nearest Centroids	
7) XGBoost
8) Skip-Gram Model
9) Transformers (BERT)




### Logic of main.py

    # Variable for adjusting how many rows we work with (for testing purposes only! For production use length of dataset)
    N = 8675  # len of dataset 8675 Users with each various posts

Choose no of rows you want to train model and make classifications

    # import raw dataset
    df = pd.read_csv("data/mbti_1.csv")[0:N]

Import raw dataset

    # create new csv file of dataset with added preprocessed text data
    df["preprocessed_text"] = df["posts"].apply(lambda x: preprocessing(x))
    df.to_csv("data/df_multi_preprocessed.csv")

Preprocess posts from users

    # Create Train and Test Split
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df, 0.3, 42069, balancing=True, binary=False)

Create train and test split and choose in function whether you want to balance (Oversampler with not majority strategy) 
and whether you want to encode the target variable for binary- (1 - Introverted | 0 - Extroverted) or multi-classification

    # Data Exploration
    preprocessed_text = df["preprocessed_text"]
    exploration(X_train, preprocessed_text, 100)
    visualize_3D_context(preprocessed_text, "think", 300, 5, 5, 20)

Exploration function outputs the most frequent 100 words.
visualize_3D_context function outputs the 20 context words of a given word.

    # Feature Generation and Vectorizing (TFIDF, BOW or Embeddings) of Training corpus for Classification
    X_train_vec, X_test_pad_seq, vectorizer = feature_generator(X_train, X_test, y_train, 2, "tfidf", 0.95,
                                                                10000, maxsenlen=100)
    X_train_Feature_Matrix = BERT_Features(X_train, False, max_len=30)
    X_test_Feature_Matrix = BERT_Features(X_test, False, max_len=30)

Create and select Features with feature_generator for Naive Bayes and Neural Network and BERT_Features function for BERT Deep Neural Network.

    # Classification
    naiveBayes(X_train_vec, y_train, X_test, y_test, vectorizer, binary=False, k_fold=True)  # use bow or tfidf for vectorizer!
    NN_classifier(X_train_vec, y_train, X_test_pad_seq, y_test, vectorizer, binary=True, maxlen=50, epoch=1)  # use different embeddings for vectorizer!
    BERT_classifier(X_train_Feature_Matrix, X_test_Feature_Matrix, y_train, y_test, binary=False, epoch=3, maxlen=30) # use BERT Features!

Call Classifiers. Every function is given vectorizer (i.e. Embeddings; TFIDF only for naiveBayes). Also choose training parameters (epoch, maxlen)
and whether to do k_fold and binary- or multi-classification.
