#### Problem
In order to classify the different personality types, we use a multi-classification approach. Furthermore,
we use the following paradigms for solving the multi-classification problem:

##### Algebraic Models
1) Naive Bayes Model
2) ...

##### Probabilistic Models
1) Skip-Gram Model
2) Transformers (BERT)
