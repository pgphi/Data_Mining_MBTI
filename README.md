# About this Project

#### Motivation

#### Problem
In order to classify the different personality types, we use a multi-classification approach. Furthermore,
we use the following paradigms for solving the multi-classification problem:

##### Models for Classification

1) Naive Bayes Model (Baseline)
2) Decision Trees	Random Forest	
3) Logistic Regression	
4) LVM
5) kNN
6) Nearest Centroids	
7) XGBoost
8) Skip-Gram Model
9) Transformers (BERT)
