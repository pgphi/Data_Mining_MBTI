turned now im and a friendless loser with a way to get alcohol p casual drinker though it make sitting at home by myself more enjoyable it also make me le this especially for katniss in the movie and book though for the movie we see more of her emotion reading the book before knowing mbti i related to her a lot isxjs but saw shes much your friend suck get new friend it never fun to be the stupid one in the group whether or not it accurate once someone in a group becomes ostracized like that theyre screwed if i wa a an actual isfj i find people around me are determined to think im stupid because i dont get off by tearing people apart and i dont see the need to voice every thought i have i think a lot of i dont know how there are so many isfjs in the world considering how stressed out we are like your friend id read what i wrote over and over again wondering what i said wrong and who want i feel a bit ridiculous but i dont try to stop worrying altogether because i believe my worrying is justified a in people really have just not wanted to respond and it so ingrained in me thats lame of them it hard to know a friend or acquaintance feel that way it happened to me a lot so i feel you i also understand worrying about where someone is it one thing if they i think one isfj problem is fearing the worst when someone doesnt reply and still hang on for their reply if you dont have that trait cool but i did for a long time until i gradually stopped dont feel like you need to get back on topic im struggling to form a response to everyones suggestion that go beyond thank you youre right thats a good idea no im not gon na kill i should probably just start a hobby i did start reading a book series and thats nice but i dont have any big goal in life so im having difficulty giving a shit about anything i should or im a most likely a www yes being a messy and forgetful a i am is one two reason ive doubted being an isfj i deep down want to be neat and i sometimes have an excellent memory but i can be quite forgetful and i agree a well i can totally understand where the paranoid isfj came from a ive had it too and people have a history of going behind my back so i think mine justified but that doe not youtube if you get a question specifically math or physic question that are newunknown or you are challenged to answer it cause it is a hard question or cause it new and unknown will you attempt the idea of an isfj aries is ridiculous without getting into moon and all that but here i am im pretty evenly split between them for good and bad trait discounting their life experience and mental illness i think my mom esfp and my dad estj im definitely isfj forgive me for people cant tell why im upset but they can usually tell somethings bothering me if it intensely bothersome depends on what it is i can get fidgety more quiet than usual look i dont recall my pottermore result but i took the question helloquizzy test this year and barely got hufflepuff that disappointed me but it make complete sense i cant argue with it my no im really not i appreciate other nice people but i dont like the way i am all degree in fahrenheit this is how i feel a well chilly weather including snow is great close to zero is just too cold i once felt degree weather in colorado and it just sucked my last time i took the test i got physical touch which make sense since even little touch really make me feel good i think quality time and touch are my top two language i never get to do much i think dom ti and tertiary si could result in the need to collect information to understand something or just for fun but tine would explain your need for variety like your isfj friend i could i hate to reply without actually contributing thing maybe ill add something when i get home from school but considering what ive seen on your typing tumblr and this post here id go with intp dont apologize for not being a native english speaker having actual conversation in a nonnative language is pretty cool okay so you did mean texting thank you for clarifying public speaking a far a texting is that what you meant by chatting in your app phone and iming v talking it depends on the isfj im personally pretty socially awkward and incompetent in person but i without knowing him individually im not sure what to say if he doesnt have a crush on you he never going to tell you never in that case youd have to initiate i apologize for isfjs fear youtube ill try to include pro and con my memory not photographic but even people who are actually intelligent able to make connection and do thing with them imo have been impressed long term so we have fise sefi nefi or fine i think i know ne is idea and se is action but i still have trouble distinguishing them in actual character maybe shes even a messed up t the bolded one are from a typing tumblr the others are my own awful guess infj isfj agnes poker house istj katniss hunger game ree dolly winter bone istp mystique first class is movie tiffany a fe dom she seems to do whatever she feel like doing make me think she ha fi and se somewhere in there i think other isfjs are great and people in general could learn a lot from their kindness i just seem to have all the problem of one without any of the good trait yay for other isfjs fuck i am tired of dealing with everyone el bullshit so you know what here is how everyone is fucking up their own life and my own and im going to abandon you and do what i want because i i honestly dont know and am probably completely wrong i wa just thinking s are going to be le emotional and peoplepleasing than other isfjs thats all

connect to certain you should right that make no sense sometimes people need assurance it isnt coddling to try to help someone we all need it from time to time your bloated sense of selfimportance is embarrassing i dont know if you think youre being blunt or showing tough love but you just come off a a prideful asshole to actually respond i dont think you can accurately ass them from their reaction to these sort of thing despite the fact that most of them are in multiple video ballpark guess maybe hey there this isnt a stupid question at all and it is a very common thing for someone seeking to understand their type to struggle with youre not alone there at all and the people who think theyre better or smarter than others for starter haha it sound like you could be an siuser based on what youve shared here i encourage you to explore mbti further and figure out your function you could very well be an infp but it just a likely looking back on my original choice i think caitlin is definitely an istj now fit far more i wasnt aware of that youtube seems more inclined to his personality type but thats interesting to know i dont think i really relate to what youre describing it sound slightly like fi but i cant be sure angelcat i dunno if thats a fair assessment if people understand the function and align themselves with a certain type who are we to tell them you cant be this type because x while many may well his line of work kind of call for a presence on social medium but you got me pretty much this i consider myself a teetotaler jon snow seems more of an isxp to me and katniss is an istp other than that were in agreement id add sansa to the list of awesome sj starks though personally i think ned is isfj cat estj i think our understanding of mbti and stereotype which were both using are very different a are our experience with the type conflicting si oh no d the bolded i definitely the popularity of certain topic and interest suggests lot of intuitives and especially lot of fiusers there are a lot of infps in particular from my experience im not suggesting all infps while you have a point i think there is definitely an mbti or at the very least a personality component to it for example n are more numerous on the internet than in real life not a haha this is a great thread but this one little thing got me im sure there are some but tumblr and most place like it like reddit etc is the one place where there are probably more it depends on the guy look at mammon and i both isfjs but have a very different idea of the ideal girl id say an esfj would be interested in someone who downtoearth and practical and i think this is si and fe working together to be honest si remembers what fe felt during the conflict and it can cause an isfj to hold a grudge or ob over the conflict or simply bring back you do sound like an isfj if i had to guess especially the bit about wanting to know the background on something before watching i always do that with moviestvbooksvideo game i want to i think measuring intelligence in general especially when ignoring that there are many different kind of intelligence is a fool task but applying sweeping generalization onto an entire portion i shouldnt be surprised by this or this thread in general im on the estp forum but come on you people could really use some sj caution in your life youre gon na regret doing whatever some there the thing intuitives do the same exact thing to sensor on this forum you dont like my completely unpractical theoretical blah blah blah no offense but some of you ne user are on a i consider myself devout though im not always a good christian i think it is probably common for most isfjs sjs in general probably to have some level of religious belief depending on what they people tell me that i am but i honestly feel mean at the risk of stereotyping many intuitives especially younger one have very ironically shallow borderline pretentious notion of what depth really is intuitives in general are more likely doe sound like a typical isfj guy to me but while type isnt a real barrier in relationship ive noticed that it can be difficult when two people are very similar in temperament i cant say wow i like the article but this is something that can be really hard for me to do number especially ring a bell with a certain person in my life taking the advice is going to be difficult spy istj villain intj rock star esfp knight isfj princess isfj bodyguard istp heir to a large company entj martyr esfj soldier istj overprotective parent estj well this is just my opinion but if i had to rank them from most extraverted to least or least introverted to most esfp esfj enfp estp enfj estj entj entp infj isfj this is an interesting thread i would think entps to be not very organized at all you know inferior si bronerd and foodcourtfrenzy i find it super interesting that both of you entps he definitely wasnt i cant stand when infjs try to claim him in any way no incarnation of batman ha been an fedomaux i definitely dont see intuition at all for supes so you can scratch this is highly subjective some people may think you are some may think you arent it really depends on the other person opinion not so much how you are why not sife can manifest in different way it is the movie that are different not the character batman is still an ixtj in the more recent depiction a well a the older one those were a wa my answer not good enough for you p he definitely an isfj he the quintessential isfj comic he an isfj sometimes portrayed a an fedom exfj and mo he also an isfj not familiar enough with the other two if type is related to behavior and thinking and those are related to sexuality then type is related to sexuality a for those masculine gay guy you met yeah i met them too i also met a i know a lot of extrovert that are like this but im not sure about esfjs in particular esfjs tend to be fairly open but they probably will be hindered by their fe so most deeply personal we are the prime example of hufflepuffs actually dragongirl sjs in general but sfjs in particular nice post it may be cliche but i feel this way about the song landslide by fleetwood mac youtube probably lesser known but i also really love the song the call by apologize to her genuinely dont just be sorry you got caught give her some space for now but try to mend the relationship admit that you were wrong this is a difficult scenario she probably i think there are far more mistyped infps then isfjs on the infj forum but thats just me shortage of male feeler in there and incredibly observant on the playbuzz quiz cheapsunglasses but it wa a lot easier than the other one take it from an isfj shes an istj p i think shes a pretty obvious istj changing your personality type go against everything mbti and typing system like it attempt to explain you understand that right leaning a bit more s than n i dont think you fully im not impressed personality develops over time yes you said type change it doesnt consider me enlightened im open to the idea of being wrong but were talking about mbti i dont believe i said anything that conflict with the theory you on the other hand

from a test i took on facebook year back in high school and apparently got isfj even before i knew what mbti even wa so im pretty they have to do a lot to get me to dislike them i dont think i ever had hatred for someone in my life this person would have to be ridiculously rude have double standard conceited skyrim i used to be a heavy video gamer but after my second year of college ive abstained from electronic gaming in favor of other thing to do however all i have to say i went back i have an istp friend he definitely not on par with al pacino but you can tell when he angry glare silence frown tendency to randomly punch a wall here and there i dont see how thats your fault in any way possible in fact i commend you for doing so much and thinking of a way to help your friend out when shes down in the dump unfortunately she wa what he said i dont know how to do that thing to link your name someone teach me d ive noticed people werent really interested in getting to know me better or were very reserved in based on your cognitive function your type is most likely most likely isfj or second possibility esfj or third possibility infp your cognitive function introverted sensation si average yeah just give him your phone number it cant hurt im sure if youre a girl it different ie creeper asking for your but between guy i think he just want to befriend you which in most hitting in january i remember taking part in a similar poll long before back then i chose the range time fly completely agree if it the choice between a page paper and a midterm id go for the paper because itll give me all the time i need to make it perfect in order to earn a good grade whereas fairly nearsighted ive been wearing glass since must be all those saturday morning cartoon i watched im not too sure how bad they are i think it bad enough to the point one of my best friend who ive known since the beginning of college til now rd yeartobe and who been living with me for more than a year now is isfj we get along pretty well and we can i love this thread i mustve downloaded more than image now after viewing all page uploading them somewhere safe now i just want to rub my head back and forth along a kitty mocha can i share too even if im not an entp nyan nyan nyan survived hour of blasting this while memorizing biology for an exam this thread need to be stickyed it too important to be lost in archive tldr so responding to ops question did make an effort to scan some other reply though i know a few intjs and theyre all pretty different in the way they respondact but i cant see them haha thats so funny because im pretty much the opposite and you sound like my friend who i go shopping with sometimes she would follow me around for an extra hour after shes done i feel would you ever consider going bungee jumpingskydiving bungee jumping sure if it just only wasnt so expensive at those amusement park a for skydiving i would like to try at least once my apology if this thread doesnt quite fit the context of the subforum but here go im leading an ice breaker activity for a group of youth aged this coming sunday and someone i usually fall asleep pretty quickly usually le than minute sleep usually come pretty easily for me unless im recovering from jetlag which happens occasionally when i pull allnighters if it organic chemistry pretend the molecule are talking to each other in the process of reaction just dont do it on the campus library people will think youre crazy unless it exam week more or le i have the same feeling a the poster above i like praise because it a positive feedback from those i help it tell me that they notice they are thankful and im performing the my good friend is an intp we get along very well and amazingly too because we actually dont share a lot of the same interest except working out at the gym and chemistry same major same yeah i type with all of my finger i think when my dad first bought a window and hooked it up with the ancient dial up back in the day i did the huntandpeck until i actually learned in you might just have to be very explicit and tell her how you feel sometimes i might care for someone but just dont really show it i think about it and everything but when it come to outward i usually just lurk around and read what others have to say i think what teddy said is pretty true i have this habit of typing a reply then realizing that it might not be worth it and never im in a college fellowship which is one ministry out of many that are affiliated with a large local church near campus the other ministry include ministering to other age group and people who i hate micromanagement whenever i do a task i like to focus solely on that task until it completed i wa never one to juggle several task at once whenever i have to do several thing at once at first i thought that wa hilarious then i realized if she fell forward wouldnt she drown she cant get back up and her face will be in the pool she cant even roll to face up because of for me it depends on who im with and sometimes what im doing i think among my introverted friend im the most extroverted it irritates me sometimes to be hanging out with them and having hello all i wa wondering if any isfjs here are in nursing im currently in college nd year and i wa thinking of maybe switching major im currently chemical engineering it not bad but i hey there from my personal experience become friend with girl first shift outside the comfort zone a bit and explore youll end up meeting some pretty cool people from the opposite gender entps are cool my roommate one i love hanging out with him although i feel sometimes he is a distraction when i need to get work done hmm when stranger offend me yeah i kinda get annoyed unless i see that theyre those carefree type and what they did wa unintentional friend i reply in kind and we laugh it off if it happy birthday have you ever thought of becoming a nurse or pharmacist when i wa applying to college which wa just last year i decided to go with biochemistry because i enjoyed chemistry biology and what did u find most difficult in school nothing school from k felt it wa really smooth i loved every aspect of it anything i disliked would probably just be something trivial like spending if it something worthwhile i usually tell most friend i meet throughout the day i lose track of who i tell the story to and sometimes i end up telling the same story a second time to the same thanks lady k for the great advice sound like i should start a cleaning schedule argh here in the dorm the janitor just clean the bathroom for u guess that luxury is going to slip away so im moving into a suite next semester with other guy two of them are isfjs and one a istp any

possibly the sweetest post ive ever seen here someone to watch a movie with me preferably someone who will put their arm around me and generally be awesome i want him to want me maybe he doe also dont want to be sick oh god i feel for you sad like i mentioned earlier i prefer that kind of honesty even though i might take it personal initially sometimes if what you say seems harsh but it seems to differ between different isfjs id yeah i guess it depends on how you define it but the example he gave wa something id be able to handle i dont agree with you on this at least not in this situation i dont like every friendship to be like this but i absolutely need a friend or two who will call me out on my bullshit and tell me im thinking about cake blackberry cake and those damn delicious looking blueberry meringue thing in the caf at the museum i work at have to watch them all day if you believe thing arent great with her boyfriend all i can say is be the best person you can be give her the possibilty to realise that she might be better off without the guy it can be hard an isfj can leave their partner for another person i did once however the other person wasnt the only reason for me leaving my current boyfriend he wa more of a catalyst i doubt an isfj will i wa gon na say this but then i saw that you had already said it id definitely pick and im norwegian hardly sound like isfj behaviour at all are you sure about her type ive never met an isfj who wa that inconsiderate of people feeling and rarely heard of isfjs who threw temper tantrum i loved it i wa so afraid for one moment when quill began his heroic speech after saving gamora but no that wa also hilarious good observation about thanos though id need to rewatch it yay saxophone how long have you been playing and what kind of music do you play i study for a bachelor degree in classical saxophone i also play the piano and the violin mostly folk music if there were objective standard to maturity there would have to be objective standard to personality that being said i dont view maturity in itself a bullshit learning to know yourself and i get along with entps quite well in real life never had the impression they viewed me a simple we usually have great discussion where both party can say what they mean without worrying about is thanos xntj just because he evil p we only heard him speak for about ten second i can agree with rocket being estj he all about his plan other than that i havent thought much i actually considered voting istj because the two istjs i know both come off a very sweet im a little surprised more people havent voted for them theyre cuddly yes they are both of them agree with a lot of the logic your post but you dont have to be an intuitive to identify with the trait ascribed to ravenclaw this is well done i wonder though how much correlation there actually is what house you end up in ultimately depends on your own choice meaning it ha more to do with value than function now i rarely speak in absolute but im inclined to agree for the most part i always want to believe the best of everyone so i will always want to forgive if it possible this mean that when i i liked most of your post teddy so i feel like commenting on a few thing yep reading this thread i get the feeling that a lot of the people who claim that they understand sjs dont how isfj of you tongue oh god i know if there no particular reason for it happening and you never get true closure that really suck i mean sometimes friendship fade naturally but when you want to keep going the conclusion is the same for me i will stop initiating contact however i really really do not take the matter of losing a friend lightly i will try to talk thing over even though i hate oh the subtle istj avoidance please just tell them ive been subtly avoided by an istj once and it fucked me up p what am i thinking about how unfortunate that i should meet the best entp shut the fuck up snoring cousin

attentionseeking weird with tragically low self esteem what nt who complain about infps picture maybe isfp she can seem extroverted but i sometimes feel shes trying hard to be that and and that take a lot out of an introvert i got w w w i dont know i relate to different part of the head type in the past i thought i wa a but i have questioned that recently i could see the nine question in there all three seem to indicate ixfp but definitely introverted enneagram or mbti is fine for mine i have more vanity and pride that i like to admit to i tend to analyze my feeling what would bonnies enneagram be i lean toward or her focus is annalise and protecting her but i might be looking at her character to narrowly my dream seem mundane in comparison to what the rest of you experience lol i dont have this one much now but another one is i am back in school and i dont know what is going on or i am way i often dream i am in a large building medical hotel store etc and it all or largely empty other type of dream have me either on a road trip something we did a lot a i wa growing up samequote i didnt expect to like veronica so much more than betty but i do interesting twist with miss grundy yes it so not the comic version i like the show but i agree it seems like they want to make riverdale into twin peak reggie probably is estp but i dont think we have seen the ti to this i sometimes question if i use ne or ni but when i read stuff like this i know i use ne i guess the question is more if it actually my inferior function the possibility the odd connection i agree veronica estj betty esfj jughead infp cheryl archie reggieugh m grundy isfj with nothing to analyze i will just do the five i have noticed some poster on pc say they dont notice the taste of their food much and that could be inferior sensing at least inferior si i wa thinking this about thisjust my best guess house w wilson w maybe w cuddy w cameron w or w over exaggerated and delving into the extreme of healthy and unhealthy or not im gon na split some hair about mr hudson i rectify what i wrote that she wa esfj she must be enfj she had kind one of my guilt pleasure i watch certain show for a distraction thinking about the adult mr ratburn istj binkys mom esfj bitsy baxter enfp that wa so funny i wish i could say that sometimes i never that sure about dws type i wa thinking of character like molly and rattle now that they arent bully molly probably an estp or isfp not about but a family member she ha exceptional people skillsgood at helping others shes good with money good at saving and planning no real ego about her but she is perhaps w maybe a enfj i go back and forth between aggressive although not violent and meek it seems like an odd combination the first thing i notice about a room is the smell outdoors a well why fife fi fi fi more fi fi generally fe but i do feel more drawn to certain individual and group fi fe fi what about gayle i have just been watching the thanksgiving episode when bob ha to pull her through the snow in a kiddie pool and it turn out shes faking her injuryshe is so annoying but that really made me laugh about tina she doe have her fantasy which i guess is why she is considered to user higher ne but it limited to her a few thing she seems obsessed by gene is so are you sure you are isfj i get crazy isfp vibe from you like almost all of your statement reminded me of my isfp bf isfp i love adventure and being in the moment but i cant help but istp seems likely i have done this so many time but maybe i can do it again without being too repetitive when i think of hobby it more the passive or indulgent type i enjoy louise fascinates me i am not completely sure her type i could be convinced otherwise i do sometimes find inferior ne and fe difficult to tell apart both seem emotional could tina be ti i would say tina is some kind of isxj inferior ne stress you out and she ha that even in minor situation the thing is it also can bring out a goofy side bob istp linda esfj the bed i will miss mary but i guess it inevitable i have seen various typing for her estj entj entp even istp seems like a lot of fe and ti maybe ne and ti interested in and trying to understand different thing entp i am one who will brood when hurt i may want to talk about it but the word are a unconscious childhood message type it not okay to have your own feeling and identity this is more in general i felt this it not like it intentional but a much a you feel like could sherlock need to goad others push their button be inferior fe after what happened to mary i wa thinking it might show inferior sethat he doesnt take consequence into account he didnt yes i think estp make sense for haley ti with her is often figuring thing out to her advantage you see it play out with feshe also will point out to alex it help if people like you i hadnt thought about intp for lily interesting im never sure about her type yes i am back to esfj for gloria after watching a handful of episode recently she is an fj and so is cameron gloria is the esfj and cam is the enfj haley definitely us fe isfp maybe dont pay too much attention to my type i m not sure of it try a i might to plan ahead i often do better to adapt a something happens similar when i write the best i may be wrong but i thought the most recent episode could be a good example of inferior se for sherlock his need to goad sometimes make him forget about consequence he didnt know what mary peppermint patty seems to use fi not fe she miss a lot too for someone with strong se maybe estj i dont know shes my favorite arthur istj buster enfp could he be anything else francine estj brain intj muffy esfj sue ellen esfp fern infp george isfp binky isfj prunella not sure low

deliberately lie about being interested in you romantically thats not something we do that would hurt you and u isfj take matter of the heart seriously when people it kind of hard to help with such an interesting situation but here my take on it isfjs are kind of needy and constant contact in a mature relationship isfjs are shy but not a shy the im very open minded isfjs i guess are supposed to be more conservative but i consider myself pretty liberal isfjs are naturally social but im not social at all really if i could oh we do know what youre playing at laughing i have a great capacity to love i love my family and care for them on a personal level i have a few close friend that i love immensely a well i would love to date an entp my best friend is one and i love her to piece i have trouble with trusting people though i dont think thats necessary because im an isfj but i would definitely isfjs dominant function according to mbti is introverted sensing si which basically mean that we consider our experience ultimately our best resource and tool to navigate our life these yes im a very nice person if i had a nickle for every time someone called me sweet id be a very wealthy person the le i know someone the nicer i am im polite and almost a little too gender female hair color dark brown with ton of honey highlight hair style long and layered usually naturally wavy or tamed straight i prefer wearing my hair up in a cheerleader ponytail i really dont want to insult anybody this post is only my personal opinion but i think that the type that i find the least attractive is an esfp emotional materialistic inconsiderate and when i love someone their need become mine their problem are my problem i feel the need to fix everything for them kind of i try to anticipate thing they need or want im very cuddly i dear enfp i hated you when i met you i had never met such an outspoken profanityladen jerk before i had to deal with your miserable loud attitude for week then i realized you make me infps are adorable my younger brother is an infp and he is in another world half the time they are extremely sensitive but they dont always show it they love to cuddle but wont ask for it when it come to something i know something ive proven that i can do again and again or if i am sure im right about something im very confident i can look someone straight in the eye and tell im an isfj trying to date an isfj it very difficult it like were both trying so hard to please each other and not offend the other that everything come off kind of distant im pushing i regret to inform you that all sjs are boring people who dont like to think for themselves and lack the ability to create just like how youre probably planning on ruling the world soon i time exists time is relative for u here on earth the sun rise and set to complete a day this is because the earth rotates then the earth rotates around the sun we call one full completion this is almost exactly what happened to me my intj roommate of two year told me she wa moving out very suddenly left and hasnt attempted to establish contact again it happened just like that i usually dont open up to anyone other than my best friend because i know she wont judge me other than that i give people slice of me but not the whole cake i have a pretty low self esteem i i dont know im the oldest of four kid when i wa my parent divorced my mom hated cooking cleaning everything like that my dad told me it wa my responsibility to take care of my i dont think that isfjs are the only personality that stick around in chaos and hairy situation because of love family or duty ron weasley harry potter hermione harry potter dutylove isfjs are fairly straightforward kind of people i feel that she would tell you if she wa having issue because youre a really close friend isfjs really trust people in their little circle i yes im very conscious of all the mistake i make i say about a hundred prayer a day that people wont comment on that flaw in my handwriting the semantic mistake in my speech or the million maybe it an introvert attribute im quiet even when i try to be loud others tell me im pretty quiet it take a genuine effort for me to talk i dont like to talk when i do talk it hey guy this is one of my first thread so forgive me if this is too sloppy unsure i just want there to a thread dedicated to discussing this very significant aspect of our personality the i have loved to read for a long a i can remember ive been the bookworm shy girl since elementary school i find reading completely fascinating it a great escape from reality especially when so here are some pic of me from a trip to visit my family in guatemala this is me at san phillipe castle im on the left in the first pic my entp sister is on the right this is at i grew up with my entp sister her personality is so complimentary to mine i would be completely thrilled to find someone with her zazzy personality maybe a j

other people if i notice they need something or want something i do just about anything to make it happen if you could anthropomorphize yourself into an animal would animal would represent you a dog name an accomplishment that you are proud of something im proud of of myself ha i i become impatient with myself and inconsiderate people i hate it when i lose thing forget thing mess up or disappoint others i also become impatient with thing or people that arent doing im usually at home i like to play the piano watch movie read be on the computer and play the viola but sometimes i go out to the library grocery store movie or restaurant lately ive people have asked me if i could change my type what i would change it to and ive decided that although it would be nice to be wise and intuitive a infjs im the way i am because i want to be pier mal is an estj he like to be around people and is a great leader he is organized and rational he is not an idealist he is practical and actionoriented he is a classic estj scar can i talk about avatar the last airbender too please because i dont think we have enough dataevidence to prove character type in lofk right now legend of korra korra estp mako i know of only one other isfj and she isnt all that interested in psychology at least im pretty sure she isnt i like psychology but i dont think that i would study it in school or anything when you finally find the word to explain how it is to be with others by reading this brilliant quote xsocializing is a exhausting a giving blood people assume we loner are misanthrope reassure him that you want to hear his complaint and that it not bothering you try to include him in thing because isfjs easily talk themselves into thinking that someone doesnt like them one day in i wa a very

The cup I'm holding now is one of those...'",first off i didnt rip this thread off the enfp forum to get revenge do i have an issue with enfps no i do not besides that did i clearly state this in a tone that suggested that i wa anything that could have a potential double meaning like do whatever you want or i dont care it really depends on the tone thoughit could mean exactly what it actually mean from most ill start i would have to say intp and entp are the type im least attracted to i have both an intp friend and an entp friend and were pretty close but i could never see myself in a ripped this from the enfp forum xd so what type are you least attracted to and why would you ever consider going bungee jumpingskydiving with enough convincing yes although im also afraid of height i wasnt always in fact i used to rock climb when i wa younger i my mom is also an esfj and how you described your relationship with your mother is exactly like my own i understand her a bit but i can hardly stand her at the same time the good time are great you are hsp personally im sensitive emotionally but not at all physically that is with the exception towards extremely loud noise bankerinnovator caregiver friendly sincere and compassionate you find your reward in helping others no one could ask for a better best friend spiritual you seek a deeper meaning it extremely hard for me to say i love you even to my own family if i have that much trouble saying it to them then that mean there is little to no likelihood that ill say it to anyone else i took the test three different time and i believe i am most likely the seeker but i have gotten good samaritan and the supporter im not that helpful or a altruistic a dear particular enfj i know that we didnt always see eye to eye and miscommunication plus misunderstanding led to the end of a friendship of many year you were my closest friend and i feel yeah housework is the worst p i think when it come to family we dont feel a motivated to complete thing for them because were used to them id assume that living with a friend or a yes but this mostly pertains to thing that have to be done for myself if someone else need me to do something for them then i get the task done a soon a possible but i dont aw thank you so much blush i think i know what youre talking about with the soulsearching effect that the isfjs seem to have i see a very humble yet strong presence from everyones zen lizard thank you im glad that i could contribute in some way i know personally that ive let my past be an excuse for how ive acted currently but using that kind of oh wow cool d i feel bad sometimes because people get me nice gift i dont feel like im appreciative enough or at least i dont really appear to be im so awkward about receiving gift it home the love language here are my score from a love language test home the love language quality time word of affirmation act of service physical touch receiving gift youre welcomei wrote this especially because i needed this for myself too i think the thing we are most passionate about telling other people is what we want to tell ourselves the most for i cant read what a person is like or such but i can from what i believe determine authenticity i can smell people who are clearly not acting like themselves i can see if they have ulterior youre absolutely lovely i couldnt agree more with what everyone else said i wish i could pull off short hair it look very good on you your eye color is very beautifulblue eye are thank you i wa actually pretty apprehensive to post my own picture but seeing how everyone else wa so comfortable sharing it made me feel a little more confident i think it safe blush oh thank you so much u i just admire how beautiful everyone is on here physically and even more so on the inside d thank you again you posse both beauty on the outside and everyone on here is so lovely and charming my goodness you ridiculously goodlooking people im chopped liver in comparison thought this wa pretty applicable to the thread xd sorry it not that big at first glance lol you are a peacemaker soul you strive to please others and will compromise anyway you can war or conflict bother you and you will do anything to keep the peace you are a good mediator and a this make me so happy d im so glad that you saw it i believe sophie is a wonderful representation of isfjs im glad that you could relate to her a well i know that this movie really helped thank you so much for your response ive just been going through some rough thing and im happy to find that im not the only one who responds this way yeahsometimes i feel like im an isfj other day im not so sure i do like listening im usually more interested in what other people have to say because sometimes i feel like my own life i dont know why but sometimes if i go for a long time without talking to someone in the real world not online then i have debate or strike up a conversation in my head sometimes my thought thats just like me so far thats really been me for the past couple of week i guess ive just had a lot on my mind lately i only know one isfj guy and were pretty good friend it pretty interesting since we both have completely different interest he the classic computer geek and im the nononsense jock but i cant stand conversation hog just because im open to listening doesnt give you an excuse to tell me your whole life story and consequently not ask for mine whatsoever also people who same here im either giggly and goofy or im sporting a dead serious kind of expression usually im only smiley with people i know and actually like otherwise i seem like im putting out a cold i think all of u are quite interesting and from what ive seen on perc there are many diverse fascinating individual on the isfj forum just to prove it and that alone is just a small sampling hello everyone i just wanted to ask something fun and simple since im new to this site and all is there a meaning behind your username a particular story behind it i know right however i did find an amazing main character that is an isfj sophie hatter from the movie howl moving castle studio ghibli really did this isfj justice this movie is the character that i probably relate to the most is sophie from howl moving castle amazing movie by the way if you havent seen it go watch it online now or any studio ghibli film for nice thumb up i appreciate the reference d anyways it would be pretty ironic if you didnt like the cold given your username and all xd i can stand the cold but only for a little bit im more of a spring type of person i love seeing the first leaf pop up everywhere that fresh springgreen is just mesmerizing spring ha the im a w isfj i would agree with coming across a an istj to others i tend to put people off because im very cold at first this actually make me feel pretty horrible seeing how people react im not good with joke that take forever to get to the punchlineim not really captivating when im unsure of how something will turn out so i usually lose my audience before then im i would have say that i freeze a well i try to keep myself together in particularly hard time and i guess my own interpretation of stability is not overreacting i try to numb myself by oh youre welcome i know ive felt the same way a you have before and im glad that i could help you a little in some way based on my own experience and yeah it wa pretty weird that my i know it really hard to be direct dont let your shyness keep you from saying what you feel it obviously easier said than done but i can tell you from a shy person perspective that is just tell them how you feel i know that for myself i cant pick up a hint to save my life im extremely oblivious to any subtle hinting or romantic gesture and the only time ive ever found a ni said before i think this is more of a personal value type of thing rather than anything else i can relate to you with animal passing since when my cat passed away my mom wa much more hi maybe for a point of comparison since im very much an isfj ill do what i originally thought you were asking and answer each of the question the cup im holding now is one of those

the phone i love talking face to face if the person is a close friend or family member other than that i like texting i am super nostalgic there are song and movie that i only like because they bring back memory i love to talk about the past and all the good memory we made with my friend it usually doe but the person who told me that is also a lot different than meprobably an enfp so i can see how she thought bella and i were similar well i have the hardest teacher in the department and i know for a fact that no problem done in class will be on the test i havent had a truefalse question on a test since high school and every like many before have said and my opposite entp i have a few really close friend here they are in order of closeness lol enfj i think istj isfj isfp infp esfj everything teddy said make sense and it doe seem like you are more likely to be an infj i would just like to point out that im an extreme perfectionist in every aspect of my life work oh im sure i would like abstract algebra better ive had enough math and talked to enough people to know that my problem isnt thinking theyre boringits just all i can do to halfway wrap my thanks jem that make a lot of sense the reason i wondered about her type is because i had a relative who told me that she thought i wa just like bella another isfj math major here and i definitely feel your pain im in college now and im about to take real analysis this coming up semester not sure if i will survive umim pretty sure this say it all happy maybe stephanie meyer wa trying to overemphasize the love relationship since it is a romance novel it wouldnt be the type of book that it wa if bella put her family first and edwardbecoming a the word pain make me cringe i think inflicting pain a part of my job would probably be the only way i could do italthough i would also never choose to be in any of those position that you i do see her compelling need to become a vampire a a selfish thing i dont think an isfj would beg so much for that because one edward doesnt want it and two it ruin the relationship with her hmmi can see isfp but i think her work habit schoolwork cleaning etc and her constant need to try to make everyone happy and please charlie and her mom are more isfj also she show sj

you don't want to.'",the fact this is a thread make me so happy anyway i agree with chris kem amber dom sam and marcelreally nice to see a mature estp here because it prof the stereotype wrong i am i believe she really doe that out of the goodness of her heart with no hidden agenda vulnerable stefan need hug and affection shes the first he see when the safe door open and for a according to how i define it i can handle others emotion x thatxs not the problem imo emotion or feeling dont have to make sense according to an external logic this is really and this is not a trait that change throughout the story then what example can you give of it later on you have not given any example of neville working through thing with fi other than fefi is not the primary interactive mechanism of mbti theyre more so the place between opinion and action like a middle man if that make any sense for example the way that fi deal with ross likely an isfj i guess he could be an istjive heard some good argument for it but i think isfj is more likely either way si dom joey esfj i know he get typed a an esfp a lot i used to think n wa an isfj but when rereading the book recently i retyped a few character and he happened to be one of themhagrid wa another anyway back to n i wish i could see him a i honestly dont remember vincent well enough to weigh in on his type with total confidence i remember thinking he wa an enfp but could be wrong about that but who i do remember really since from all you have said it seems tat your thinking preference is lower then fi v fe is good place to start because typing off profile instead of cognative function is harder and open more just about that what each type a a hard time admitting to themselves thing it come originally from thought catalogue and a lot of the people on there write about mbti based on sterotypes and first thing i would say when typing yourself is howeversorry to say this but avoid online testsand the personality website all together i have come out a every type under the sun on online i can help type you if you want my thought harry potter isfp ron weasley esfp hermione granger estj fred weasley entp george weasley entp ginny weasley estp bill weasley infp percy weasley istj neville my thought harry potter isfp ron weasley esfp hermione granger estj fred weasley entp george weasley entp ginny weasley estp bill weasley infp percy weasley istj neville i would agree that louis is an istjcan we just appreciate how good he is with the detail and bylaw i just also think he is an ennegram and not a healthy one which is why we see his fi quite haha it funny you say that because a an xnfj i also feel like i wouldnt be able to do what he doe it seems like he keep track of so many thing and his attention to detail and memory are but he set literally everything up the curse getting to stroybrook to get to his son and to do so he played such a long game it wa all so clearly planned and done and involved so much forward elena and te yep pretty much although i think you could argue that we first saw her te with jeremy in the bathroom at school when she thought he wa high it wa le intense than it is later on thats interesting because ive never seen him typed a an isfj before where do you see si him i just think i struggle with it because the way that he always play the long game and plan so far hey exactly im still wondering if elena wasnt actually supposed to be an isfj in the beginning or maybe she wa suppose to be a sweet depiction from memory of a very young estj i i never saw her struggle for survival a an abstracton the extroverted j function that accompanies the ni with you although at first glance katherine doe look like an unhealthy entj i agree again very true but when taking important action one us their best asset their dominant function that is not a choice it is a need true my point wasnt that decision are made often all honesty i am not sure if jess is an enfp or not i had thought she wa buteither way i feel like this post applies since jess is the stereotypical enfps ive been wondering about their enneagram type though elena honestly she is really hard for me to work out stefan probably a but i could also really see him a a type damon type interesting idea but im not really sure he can be i mean for one any type can be an artist the whole artistinfp thing is a bit of a stereotype really but looking at the case of klaus for him first ofjust wanted to say without quoting all that wa said on it i am in agreement with you about the estj profile in general and for most estjs i would agree with this it is why we see so if it help what helped me with my enfp mother wa i looked at what i wa like when i wasnt around her i mean my ne is still stronger but when i am not around the enfps in my family my ne is yeah i agree i just cant work out if he is an intp or istp tumblr have you read this post it really highlight how much higher ne and lack of si make an ne dom im with you on the fact that he is no way an esfp or enfp i thought about isfp and infp but at this particular moment i lean towards intpor at least ti dom im just not sure how much fi i see in honestly ive got a bit of a head cold right now and my mind isnt so i hope that made sense very possibly if it help maybe consider the lower function rather than the upper one i had the opposite problem i wa getting to caught up in if i used ti or ne higher and due to circumstance maybe she is an entj but something else that crossed my mind her pregnancy wa one mistake and i dont know about you guy but i dont act only using my cognitive function and never do anything im with you on what he should of done it seems unlikely that the information wa out there but i would have a hard time believing that a high te user wouldnt make a list of the one it could have so i wa having a conversation with a friend of mine when we were trying to work out his type and

only reason im it take a lot for me to lose my cool and tell someone off it only happens once in a blue moon well tonight i made a fudge im in the process of reconciling with my husband on the condition people who think it ok to dis my family also my stepson mother who keep getting angry at my estranged husband because he keep being who he is which is the reason they arent together stop this lack tact it feel very offensive because i worked so hard on my marriage but ultimately you were right though i wasnt cry about it the complainy bit were honestly the pregnancy well the little guy is five and a half month now having a baby ha been really hard on my marriage actually my marriage is just about over my husband wont lift a finger for the baby no diaper we have standard and expect people to try and be decent human being and when theyre not we argue at least in my life i only feign humility and goodness im actually arrogant proud and controlling a far a feminism go i think gender equality is a great ideal in practice tho at least in my part of the world it mean my family need two income to survive which mean that i have to work my ne is a constant state of fear and pessimism mixed with overwhelming feeling that i have to escape my life or become more controlling and powerful it really is no wonder that isfjs are that sound like a very serious and complex issue to be honest i really dont have a lot of advice for it if i were going to put myself in your mother shoe what i would like and what would this actually this is how my friend and my sister got me into mbti at first i avoided mbti like the plague because i thought it wa too black and white and would rob me of getting to chose the thanks guy im feeling more and more like myself every day thank goodness plus the little guy figured out how to nurse so we have almost erased all the negative side effect of being in the nicu i had my little boy he wa born sick and had to be in the nicu for a week he all better now tho the lack of sleep lack of routine and emotional stress of having my baby in the nicu is i know right it would be such a terrible situation to be in tho especially a an isfj so sad the thread that op posted on the istp forum wa really interesting and informative and reading im pregnant not even just pregnant ive been due to pop any day for week now if you are here on the isfj forum on a thread about isfjistps then really the topic matter ha nothing to do with im married to an istp it a lot of work a lot of work i think this pairing is harder on the isfj than the istp and certainly in my case my husband is very much go with the flow so he doesnt i loved this article that is me to a t there is so much about isfjs and really every type that get misunderstood by the other type and i think they did a fantastic job explaining the little i wish more people viewed marriage this way it really would help a lot of struggling marriage im not a dating expert especially

theyre aware of the potential side effect why are you leaning towards isfj why do you think you use si i dont relate very well to isfj type description either and actually relate very well to infj isfj type description are full of youngandbaroque are you leaning more towards isfj or infj do you have any question im leaning towards isfj from the information youve provided in your op i actually relate very well to just about everything you said love people close to me security intelligence depth understanding beauty not just the outward appearance of thing i mean also the deep subjective personal beauty people find in sure and just so you know isfjs have really sucky stereotype p i relate more to the infj description type description can only do so much it really about function usage edit type btw i never test a s either p i always test a infj or sometimes intj test will only tell you what you tell them and theyre made with stereotype in mind that sound like it could be si id say youre isfj is this sort of thinking something you experience often that sort of example i put above for si what about other example closer to the tree example ok ill give you an idea of what im getting at here lol there are different kind of abstract the following is an example of si being ok ixfj si and ni are very similar they are both pi introverted perceiving function i think a lot of people around here would say im an infj because i may not seem like their idea of what an where doe your selfworth come from are you concerned with they way you appear to others do you need to feel validated from others give example when you can im leaning towards ixfj but im not this is insulting in such a disgusting way your post is full of misconception and stereotype im leaning towards ixxj yea do you relate current situation to thing that have happened before compare andor contrast them do you seek to look at thing from different perspective if here are some question that may help provide example whenever you can why do you say your inner world is very complex what kind of world do you create what sort of thing do you think definitely more like my mom in look and personality

wa fi dominatei did however consider other type infjintpisfp among others i didnt fit many of the im surprised they didnt include others in their click more at the very least luna and neville te ixfp isabeloceans extj yeah i really liked her character she wa their friend but they didnt always hang out together you could say the same for neville i relate to a lot of this i dont do art and craft very well i tried but at some point i figured out it wasnt my thing chick movie are not my favorite movie genre some i like a lot but i have read luna wa meant to be the anti hermione someone so opposite of hermione but also highly intelligent no i figured thats how it would play outginny had to end up with harry hermoine and ron were a great opposite attract type of couple i loved ginnys tunnel vision about harry compared to the neville would be a likely i think he also would have a w for the body type actually he interesting in that he is gryffindor not hufflepuff like cedric or tonksit show the various oh that family that ha to have a affect on a person yes i see hermione typed different way too i dont see her a a she is maybe a w but i think she ha the and in her tritype she i actually find harry harder to type than the others i see w for him and w also and im not sure the two work though and w work better for ron probably and w for voldemont that sound rightshe look for acceptance but not in a good wayimmature a well that make sense shes out there i wasnt all that sure but i can see what you mean by the lower te yes i understand fi can show their feeling that way i wasnt sure if she had lower fe i never watched pp and i have only watched ga off and on for the last couple of season so i dont havent checkcheck and checker another thing is you search for just the right word and are frustrated when you cant find them and other type dont know why thats a big deal draco wa a bully but a time go on you see where it come from he insecurehe say and doe thing for attention even negative attentionin the end he doesnt have the stomach to be truly evil snape is a great complex character not all good or bad and rather sadlupin is great umbridge is worse because in a way shes more realistic we have all known an umbridge probably more than do you think ethan is an infp i see what you mean about him being sentimental and being driven or open to idea i have questioned my original typing of ethan the prisoner of azkaban and maybe the order of the phoenix i love how quickly luna and harry become friend im also very sentimental about the first movie the sorcerer stone favorite i know i can see it now i always get caught up in the emotional part of a story but oh is he ever a se user but there i am focusing on the emotional scene such a marshmellow i can relate to this caring so much it overwhelming and you dont always know what to do or how to help i actually think this make me want to avoid people at time yet that fe is there and i i think they wanted eva green badly that might have made a difference i can understand why actor what to have some say or more say it is after all their name and face most identified with a yes i need to watch more of her interviewstrying to type people that way is still a challenge for me but it good practice yeah i wa never much of a bond fan until daniel craig i like the other actor but the movie never held my interest until daniel eva wa by far the most intriguing bond girl and her angelique wa thats very possible any condition could affect a personality imagine how being possessed would change it eva green is amazing her personality would be interesting to figure out yes i think vanessa went from and istp to a probable infj her fe show more like her kindness to john clare shes le awkward with itbut i would say it still lowkey not too flashy im not sure if monica is esfj or estj either i sometimes have the problem with woman whether they are dominate fe or dominate tei dont normally have that same issue with menit might be easier to im glad i know you help others out too but it wa good to have so much to compare the type and function i had been doing it but it wa hard to narrow down the best source this made it easier yes i do use the ti but the fe come first the isfj fictional profile helped a lot toofiguring out which came first well thank you for your patience i enjoyed it a lot even when i couldnt i think it a little of both the idea and the emotion i think i really push myself for the idea in theory it good it sometimes in practice it take more effortbut the idea other thing are my score si se ni ne ti te fi fe it very possible my own personal experience and impression seems to come before everything else a i process informationif that is how it work than it like it my dominate function yes i do that type of fe sharing i dont even think of it a being all that emotive but maybe it because it just come naturally to me i wasnt sure about be an si dominate because there are i had si and se confused for a long timei think i wa going by many of the stereotype i didnt realize how personal it isi always make reference to thing that have happened or how it one thing i can panic too whats the worst that can happen and i usually come with the one that scare me the mostmaybe a coupl of others i see several possibility most often when im trying to thank you again im going to go through all of this it look good yes i agree it odd other people can see thing in u we dont or we diminish are stronger quality other people will i pick up i know i dont know why it so hard to figure out but you have been so helpful i got it narrowed down my gut instinct is isfj but im going to do some more comparison i have a hard time i can see how i use si im so aware of how thing affect me physically too hot or coldhunger and thirst make me feel guilty when i think of anyone animal or human going without i know when a i think it either intp or isfj i need to read through this more thoroughly i can relate to both in a way

good thing that happened to me throughout the year and i would put slip of paper in a like earthtopaige i have an esfj mom and istj dad i dont really feel like my mom understands me very well were very different i think it that extroverted feeling of hers that is at the helm what did u find most difficult in school i hated feeling held back the slow pace of school and all the time wasted i didnt like how teacher played favorite this wa very obvious to me i i dont know if this is an enfj tendency or not but please let me know i have an enfj friend who take the smallest of thing personally out of context jump to conclusion etc she also joke i think we are undercredited for our overall ability to do just about anything we set our mind to i really mean that it crazy cool because so many people out there limit themselves or really so i just want to take a moment to appreciate istjs i have an istj in my life that i am very close to i appreciate many thing about him but a main one being his ability to just turn caring about okay first of all isfjs arent really going to spend a lot of time around people they dont care about or dont love i can almost tell you without a doubt that her saying ill always be there hai like this thread isfjs stubborn ha yes yes however it is only about certain thing i wouldnt call it a consistent quality throughout everything at least for myself i admit i can asking an isfj what their favorite movie is is like asking a fish to walk on dry land haha well there are so many but if it hasnt already been mentioned a walk to remember the ambassador yes i love to journal my journal work a a place to vent in order to get weight off of my chest understand myself better sometimes i use them to work out internal problem or external problem yeah i noticed the function and why they were arriving at the answer a well what i meant by wellrounded wa from the standpoint of giving a better understanding of the object to the listener how would you define love love is what life is all about from my point of view everything should be done out of love for others and love for god love is acceptance devotion kindness trust i thought it wa all well said but you hit the nail on the head with this part be introspective and open to changing for the better yes yes from the hilltop you made some great point in your whole post but i really liked how you wrapped it up i think this is one thing this thread ha been trying to get at the whole time it seems that an isfj can truly blossom when they have gained confidence in their own skin it open up so many door but it doe happen in baby step the transformation is amazing when it happens slowly starve here and there haha thanks for your response by this i just meant do your close friend provide these thing for you if so how also are these thing a need of yours in a close friendship yes i definitely kristi yamaguchi kirsten dunst kate middleton michael cane halle berry christopher walken jimmy stewart hello everyone i have been trying to catch up on reading all that ha been posted so that is why you havent heard from me in awhile this thread ha been very interesting for me and i too am glad what if youre just imagining there is a half a pizza there what if you took a bite and then became cursed and thenyou had to eat pizza the rest of your life because a your fridge turned into i actually have noticed this about myself and sometimes felt weird about it now knowing how to stop however i dont really think it is something i need to stop i even sometimes worry about how i i agree with what you are saying here i think you make some valid point much of this ha already been mentioned in the thread especially in a lot of teddy post i think it will give you a yeah i definitely think it is good to be straight forward in asking an isfj if they like or do not like something because they are going to be le likely to just say it because they dont like yes i can definitely relate to this i think it all depends on how much i really see the need to voice my opinion about something or how serious the subject is to me if it something that i really also a few more that i meant to include that are probably some of the most important i would ever like to hear i admire that you stand by what you believe regardless of what others may say you yeah i agree with several thing mentioned so far i do like compliment but a it ha been said they have to be genuine and i would much prefer a compliment about who am a opposed to what i hello enfps it being new year i find it interesting how different type deal with new year resolution so what kind of new year resolution do you enfps make or do you make any happy new year infjs what kind of new year resolution doe an infj make thanks for your reply why do you think it work so well what negative are there ive been doing some thinking about the whole surface v deep thing the longer ive been on perc which hasnt been long the more ive noticed in various thread the contrast between how s view it possible we would clash a bit lol what brings up this thought do you want to be an entp did you mean isfj user name tritype instinctual subtype stephiphi w w sp this make sense cool good deal i think it definitely good to just have time to figure thing out your dad seems really picky and doesnt sound like a stereotypical isfj so i could list several kind of gift that i like to receive but i dont think they would apply to your dad because we seem i would have to agree with you when it come to infp v esfj in dealing with conflict i have an esfj mother and conflict is terrible with her i actually can relate to everything you said it i see the similarity in that both type can get emotionally attached to thing but they deal with it differently at least me and you i see it a kind of a reverse in this instancein your

will definitely communicate with him it probably wont be exactly your word but i will definitely communicate in person and via text and handwritten letter i just hope he get the hint uhhh very good point oh dear the signal im sending him that i thought were clear are actually more complicated than i had originally thought i think he know im shy since im pretty hmmm do you guy think it adorable when girl clam up gentleman and joethebuckeye i suppose you guy are both right about him not being able to read my signal ive realized that i have probably inadvertently sent him signal suggesting that i dont oh my gosh this is so true for me too all my friend even close one think im super extroverted the infjs i know who are supposed to be able to read people have always guessed that the title of the thread is misleading i have not figured out how to change it i wa originally typed a infj but have had doubt because the description doe not match me completely however i gentleman i know istjs are hesitant to take the initiative and are really really bad at reading social sign with this guy though i am trying to be a obvious a possible without outright stargazing grasshopper i have been reading that post at least once a week ever since i stumbled upon it month ago it is an immensely helpful post for understanding istj mentality to be honest i am a bit uncomfortable with making him drive u to bible study each week because he ha to drive minute out of his way however if i drive and pick him up i barely have to thanks epicyclic would you mind explaining what you mean by trying to make a mile out of an inch joethebuckeye thanks for the suggestion i will incorporate some inside joke for sure we definitely have a few of those update i had bible study again today with this istj he open up this is why i usually emote through writing letter otherwise i cant even predict how bad of a leaky faucet i might turn into rolleyes oh the joy of being an isfj i definitely generally analyze everyone but like johnsonhan i have learned to only care about my analysis of people i really really care about those are the people that i way my inferior ne drive me crazy it make me doubt myself and generally the more important the matter the more i doubt myself frustrating for example i currently like this guy and he doe a thanks for the suggestion epicyclic i wont include picture of the two of u because i dont have any of those we also havent really been anywhere alone just the two of u i wa thinking more thanks i actually have a running list of all the little act of service he ever done for me and i will definitely pick a couple of the most memorablefunniest one to include in that letter consolidated potato yes i might do both especially taking into consideration the advice of joethebuckeye instead of making the letteropening scenario vagueemotionally charged i think i joethebuckeye oh ill istj it up a bit by handwriting it happy im super traditional and am all up for handwritten note you think thats a good idea or am i taking it a step too far with lol johnsonhan i speak fluent sarcasm too a evidenced by my keep staring thatll make me feel real good stickmyfootinmymouth moment generally i like to think i have better thank you you are very sweet care to infuse some of your e and n into that istj for me this is why i am glad i came online and sought all your advice thank you so much for sharing chanteuse a an isfj i am much better at articulating my feeling although i only choose to do so yes i can already see exactly what you mean chanteuse although to give my istj credit i sense when he stressed and am much quieter but he still take the initiative at those time to keep the i should clarify that i am an isfj and the title of the thread is incorrect i havent figured out how to change it sorry about that but i do tend to read into others feeling try not to stargazing grasshopper thanks for your input i agree that istjs are not unemotional or cold they do have lot of deep feeling theyre just not very good at expressing them i can definitely thanks for the suggestion chanteuse ill consider being very straightforward to be honest im a very traditional girl and i much prefer that the guy take the initiative however i can see johnsonhan love to get your thought thanks update thank you everyone for your encouragement and advice i confirmed with the istj that he is indeed single chanteuse you were right joethebuckeye ha ha ha well im glad we hit it off well a your lengthy and subjective guide wa super helpful for me when i first started taking an interest in this guy month ago and thanks so much right now im basically using baking for everyone at bible study a an excuse to give him half of whatever i bake i dont want him to feel awkward if i specifically bake for him do johnsonhan hahaha im tempted wrap some space up and see what he say thanks for the awesome suggestion though arieslilith im pretty straightforward when i communicate i dont tend to i am definitely a type w isfj dont know what the istjs enneagram type is though a little update i saw this guy briefly at church today he really stressed about his schoolwork for that oh and bat crap crazy im going to have to steal that one and use it sometime on my friend also how people argue with no logical sense just befuddles me hahahaha the ending of that ted talk wa hilarious based on the cake im going to have to agree that i am mostly a builder and partly a negotiator very enlightening thanks hmmm i like quiet and conservative and i definitely like old couple holding hand johnsonhan would you mind explaining what you mean by builder thanks devalight thanks for sharing your experience i have through another thread confirmed that my mbti is actually isfj the description match me much more accurately also i have a very strong te serious at work but i know how tocando joke around too crazy goofy with my closest friend but very few people get to actually see that side of me count yourself lucky if you do this especially narcissism plus people who complain all the time about everyone and everything people who dont keep their

you dont fall asleep over your textbook hahaha all right ill keep that in mind if i dont get reply from you to keep the conversation going then do you think this guy is istj or are we still unsure

similar people for many reason and an old flatmate of mine she doesnt ive always associated myself with the phlegmatic temperament more than anything else ive started and stopped typing an answer to this four time over because it kind of a confusing divide for me while yes i have been guilty in the distant past of doing nice thing because i i wont add the picture text for obvious reason but i also got a pit bull my mum actually an isfj a well although my dad likely an exxp yeah ill listen to pretty much anything so there definitely no isfj getting stuck in a routine stereotype when it come to music at least for me anyways though i do agree with mendi if it not a tv or movie but im replaying the mass effect video game trilogy and it reminded me that i also relate really strongly to kaidan alenko it probably help i also see him a an isfj this is definitely something i need to remember more dont be afraid to take time for yourself dont stretch yourself thin at the expense of your own health yeah these arent isfjrelated sorry theyre just thing you dont want to deal with also pro tip relationship arent all about what you do and do not want theyre compromise a much a for me it either ann perkins from park and recreation or john watson from the sherlock holmes canon chris evans is a pretty strong isfj a well at least imo im gon na have to deviate from shale and say your friend doe sound like an isfj in bunch of way i wouldnt say i take everything personally but i want to strangle you would definitely be one of i tend to like a character more if i can identify with them so my favourite are all generally isfjs ie john watson sherlock holmes steve rogers captain america kaidan alenko mass you are a considerate curator you are a curator you are straightforward and real downtoearth and have a healthy respect for order and stability these attribute complemented by your i wa a confused a emily because my result were but i wasnt quite sure how the problem solver would apply to me but the explanation make more sense al the time particularly re not speaking up even with my bffs ill fairly frequently withhold my opinion on something i disagree vehemently with for fear of upsetting them or even for aaahh that ol discrepancy between social medium and actual life no one ha the perfect life that get thrown up on facebooktwitter which i think is something more people need to realize i oh man a much a id love rdj to be an isfj he come off a such an entp to me welcome to the forum btw happy chris evans on the other hand i see a an isfj you are hsp pretty much agreeing with the others being a roommate ha more to do with your manner rather than your personality type i lived with about other people when i went on a study abroad trip and we fair enough i admit it wasnt a good a the first one but i still loved it imo ritchies moriarty wa spectacular the right mix of subtle gentleman and terrifying psychopath plus it haha it actually kind of doe p all of them haha but no the granada series is my goto adaptation because jeremy bretts holmes sustains me followed shortly by russianholmes by people are actually rather split over what type sherlock holmes is and even more believe his type is different depending on the adaptation but yes watson is without a doubt an isfj across the my avatar is john watson from bbcs sherlock on perc i think ive always had a different version of watson a my avatar i chose it because the sherlock holmes series ha been my favourite since i definitely like routine it comforting to know exactly what i have to do at what time it also why im told im awesome to travel with because i overcompensate for the unpredictability of i dont really know how much help i can be and i agree with teddy that im not entirely sure type affect howwhy someone lie but i use to be a bit of a pathological liar when i wa younger key yes to these in particular if ive said it once ill say it a thousand time i will defend to the death my belief in watson wilson and rory a being isfjs i agree with stephiphi sometimes it hard to feel great about yourself when there are so many thread floating around perc talking about how u sensor are doing it wrong so many feeling of i definitely agree with you re capsicle if nothing else he certainly an xsfj i think you might be misunderstanding the isfj trait that you disagree with a an isfj ive never seen myself a controlling or dominating the last thing i want is to tell someone what to do the i apologize for asking but your clarification didnt really help are you trying to say she had a boyfriend in the time period where you knew her but she no longer ha one now or doe she have a i dont know if it typical but im a type and i do exactly the same a you to be honest eventually i get burned out end up cutting off everyone in order to try and focus on myself and then im a which apparently make me an uberisfj i dont bother much with the enneagram simply because i dont understand a lot of it a teddy say there are far more enneagram type with i do get what youre saying if im around people too much or i just generally dont feel up to it the desire to start yelling and screaming tends to get a little too much however my need to be while i dont really have an opinion either way i often see holmes typed a an intp or intj on the other hand watson is always an isfj to me anyway i got the przewalskixs horse your wild gentle spirit make you very popular among the rest of the gang you like to roam free and really enjoy the company of others you certainly are not happy isfj leo ah haha it more a case of what part of watson dont i identify with were both rather tenacious people im also very open and straightforward people can read me like an open book which there really only one character whom ive identified with since i wa a little girl and thats the fellow isfj dr john watson in the original sherlock holmes series a well a any of the see i dont have to deal with that problem because i rarely use my credit card i use my debit for virtually every purchase even then for some reason my brain ha latched onto my credit card i agree with you regarding captain america i feel like he an isfj although im not entirely sure why i think he introverted rather than extroverted i have cent in my wallet at the moment i dont tend to keep physical money with me because i like relying solely on my debit and credit card it neater i dont have a bunch of random meat i do tend to like meat more than fruit or vegetable but i could never give up chocolate there is no problem that can not be solved by chocolate i turned le than a month ago i apologize but nothing freak me outagitates me more than seeing someone driving behind me who texting keep your eye on the road when youre operating a vehicle yeah alberta it is kmh on the road i am going kmh because youre tailgating me and because i usually drive about km over the speed limit because it a gray area if i really wanted to i could oh my god i adored jude law watson i had an absolutely geeky moment when i saw the movie on christmas when you see watson for the first time in the carriage with lestrade loading his pistol he

Sounds like you're more educated than I am on MBTI and Enneagram :) Glad to have you around because I ♥ INFP's|||Whatamigonnado? Say Welcome! Glad to have you finally stop lurking and join the crowd!  *hug from brave internet surfer*'",that make a lot more sense than what ive heard before what i heard wa that isfjs are i live in the united state and i only know one isfj besides myself lol so i definitely agree that thanks i wont worry about it yeah i would say youre an isfj it a pretty awesome type to be but then again i might be slightly biased i dont cry very much just because im an isfj my instinct is to help people when i cry in front of someone it make me feel vulnerable and like im the one who need help i do cry a lot i love that song from your description i would definitely say you are either an isfj or an isfp fynest one whoa you have a pretty good memory then especially the part about remembering your weight i didnt realize just how much u isfjs have in common until i started reading this whoa i loved all the thing you listed sometimes people post thing on this thread that dont seem to match up to the typical isfj but i wa like lol exactly at every single thing you listed yup i can identify with all of these whoa same for me ive only met one other isfj but i know oodles of intjs which are also one of the rarest i dont know i think i do pretty good when i tell a joke to a crowd but i have to admit that i only tell joke that ive practiced before kind of like giving a speech i dont like to wing it for me i would say warm and caring quiet reserved tactful funny aware of others considerate optimistic im still trying to understand why both of them were shot my goodness what an amazing song i wa almost in tear after i watched the video though cry no wonder it your current sad song the cold never bothered me anyway so yeah i like cold weather although my favorite season is fall not winter i like the cooler night pile of leaf and dustings of snow it so refreshing lexierose this is my favorite reply to my post i really appreciate you giving your thought i dont think you could be more spoton a i wa reading through i kept saying yeah that make so much thanks im glad it not just me youre right about if it wa my dog it would probably hit home a lot more with my emotion i know cry yeah i really like kid especially one under theyre so darn cute and lovable so youre probably right it ha more to do with your interest thanks for you reply that make a lot of sense and dont worry i wasnt going to turn in my isfj card or anything im absolutely positive im an isfj so a an isfj i have a deep care for people how theyre feeling and how i can help them but when it come to animal im afraid that im coldhearted a couple month ago my mom dog the heck yeah this happens to me all the time ill have to pay attention to which one i listen to more slate harsh yup thats me and my mom here is a link to play simon free online basically the computer will play a color pattern you just have to repeat the pattern each time you successfully repeat the that is so cool my mom is an intj and her instruction were usually pretty vague in fact there were even time that she would say can you go get the thing from downstairs and expect me to yup this sound pretty spot on to me by the way bluekitdon that is one fantabulous avatar raawx im curious what you mean when you say someone can be esfp with enfp trope what are trope i definitely agree with what others have said isfjs want to be needed if we feel like a relationship exists for our benefit were not happy at all at least in my experience im not sure all the i feel you there my schedule can be booked and i still find myself saying yes to everyone i know caccioppoli yeah i guess so i usually dont feel that way on the inside but i probably end up being very composed and calm on the outside because im an isfj and all sophi me too i would love to be an author i hope you get a chance to someday soon thanks okay so in the past couple week ive received an unusually large amount of compliment about how im levelheaded stay calm and make good decision in stressful situation frankly these youtube ive often wondered how accurate the population percentage statistic for mbti type are for example my type is supposed to be the most common accounting for of the population ive only met wow that sound like me ive tried a daily schedule with time slot several time over the last couple year and it only last for a week or two i inevitably fall behind my time slot and then sophi are you a professional writer or do you do it a a hobby i think writing is so cool and i wish i could do it more amazing song ive never heard it before and i love it i like it talk about sensible thank you that is very encouraging to hear oh dear that is hilarious and sad all at the same time i remember a time in one of my class a pretty large one when my instructor made some announcement and asked someone to come up and btw cool avatar thanks for the input this is getting crazy scary music start playing it doesnt sound like this is an issue with just a specific browser or antivirus software maybe there a hacker on the yes exactly i like being the goto for people when they need help and support when im feeling bad and accept help from someone else i feel like i cant help other people now i tend to this is interesting no im not using avast i am using firefox a my web browser ha virus blocker addons and norton a my antivirus software lol about creeping on the intjs yeah it seems like it work when i go the perc homepage but it when i try to access the isfj subforum that it try to block it welcome sound like youre more educated than i am on mbti and enneagram glad to have you around because i infps whatamigonnado say welcome glad to have you finally stop lurking and join the crowd hug from brave internet surfer

this here anyway my take on the mbti typing of the character anna i wa originally let me try the wreckitralph character ralph esfp unhappy with the current reality of him living excluded from the group and party mostly a respect for his work he take this neglect very how would you define love ive always been told that love is a choice and interestingly enough ive found that to be true just to clarify where im coming from though i had to learn that love company for my ideal mate i think that the one word i would use to describe them is uninhibited the thing i seek in a partner is someone who always look to moving forward personally and see career and i think i would say telepathy it funny how many time someone described what their thinking i respond with how i understand they say wos you said that better than i did i posted in another forum my top and why but here i think im just going to make a list of my top forrest gump batman the dark knight wreckitralph monster university a week ago i would have said minion from megamind he a very servant oriented person and rather than initiate he follows the mindset of megamind no matter how askew it may be that said i i really should have posted on this forum at some point but i guess better late than never so im just going to do a top with a blurb about why here my top a it stand i might be i had problem with spiral thinking and my advice get help sometimes having one person who can dedicate an hour without trying to fix the problem immediately to get a better understanding of the i think i know exactly how you feel in a way my biggest problem i think i have is that i feel like people need to engage with me more initially before like more so than normal before i open up i a list of thing i find humerus pun and wordplay thing well thought subtle thing inflection piece of scenery character etc made obvious and now for the joke news anchor that she is i just read through for perspective and now im sad that i cant finish their journeyunsure minion from megamind is the isfj i probably most relate to and if anyone want to cant say he hardly get any character time in the movie im gon na say that he similar to the book which make me think intj i cant explain why i think so other than to say that he seems to you are a dreaming soul your vivid imagination take you away from this world so much so that you tend to live in your head most of the time you have great dream and ambition that could be for some reason that wa all i wa sure of a a kid that i wanted to do for me this wa my i wan na be a firefighter type of thing but i never acknowledged it funny thing is ive never board gamesshocked omfgcrazy i love board gameslaughingcrazytongue sorry about that omfgunsure i dont usually do that i swear anyway here all the board game i love roommate infp isfp inxp he say he an infp but i suspect that he an intp overall he is very hard to type friend off campus estp esfp istp infj i follow my gut feeling except about people when their facial expression seems off i peek my interest like i do with my mom but mostly i cant say that i have a very good read on people but i here my story i wa diagnosed with autism at the young age of two so much of my early childhood wa engaging in my sens hearing primarily and getting me to comprehend and manage them and interesting theory which i like and good example save for three which i never identified with a isfjs simon tam pepper potts and captain america simon is probably the easiest to explain so for me the need to be needed come up when i feel people dont value me or my opinion wait did i just describe it a itself my need to be needed doesnt really come from any specific entps very smart clever and fun people i enjoy my time with them however they can be messy and sometimes they will get frustrated with some of the most trivial thing that seem to be out of i would say the isfjs look for housemate not house mate a in if we can live together we should get married although that is a feature what i mean is that we are very close to home and i would say not even but thats just me i am an isfj my younger brother is an entp one of my best friend is an entp my older sister is an intp the friendship are great me and my brother have so many inside joke and are preformed isnt it possible to be an isfj without potraying every aspect of being an isfj a described i see mbti a an internal process of priority rather than a descriptor of personality for example on a scale from how happy am i content with room for improvement socially skilled am i im not a proficient a delegating a others but seeing some of the drama i see so im in my third year of college and ive switched major twice now ive turned to being a film study major now and ive been struggling with what exactly what i wanted to do after college when when this topic come up there two instance i think of where the romance didnt start off a passionate both are fictional but ill address that the first is tevye and golde from fiddler on fair enough now that i think about it my isfp sister did come to that conclusion a well and i havent even looked at and mbti test for who know how long it still stand that i think youre an why do you because you may be an intp in disguise thentongue just kidding i cant think of anyone else that doe except my intp sister you want evidence no one would analyze care or even think about how a dichotomous test italicized because thats an intp word would be faulty except for intps i wa going to say you know who you remind me of my intp sister and i wa just going to give example of what my sister would say when asked these question but putting them back to back it you know you are an isfj when you hear the phrase isfj action hero and get really confused unless youve seen the secret of nimh then you immediately think mr brisby well where the hell are we gon na find those tv show i watch now survivor avatar legend of korra how i met you

easily swayed towards volunteering for the good of a group im with those who think most type could be im not sure if it would ever get published because it very much a slice of life story rather than something with a proper plot a such it based on the woman and a few of her friend and shudder twilight isnt a good example of any genre i suspect anne elliot in jane austen persuasion is an isfj also try a book called the total tragedy of a girl named hamlet by erin dionne if shes not an isfj shes not too far from how i totally agree i set myself a challenge to write a book where the main character is an isfj with all our flaw but also our strength i am about of the way through it an interesting im isfj have loved doctor who since i wa a kid i grew up with it probably a repeat since i doubt i wa old enough to remember pertwee from the first time round and i know i saw his episode i had a casualish outdoor wedding in the garden of an old house then we went inside to a smallish reception which wa just a buffet so no big deal served meal for u i did have my dream dress nope not at all in the generally understood i like traditional value and think society should never ever change because liberal nonsense is bad sense of the word in the do i like tradition of kanerou i identify quite heavily with what you say im sure im an isfj but many of the trait ascribed to isfjs turn me cold many of them are not what i consider desirable and in a lot of in general i agree but that mother repeatedly did something that wa clearly hurtful and upsetting to her child and eventually that child lost her temper it happens and i doubt she totally woah this is a bit harsh respect ha to be earned and if the mother is telling these embarrassing story and disrespecting the child then no she certainly doesnt deserve respect respect isnt hmmm i think you should do it if you do it and just let it speak for itself you wont have to go up to people what youll get is people who are at least curious talking to you about it so you i kind of see these a two different thing first for me to start hanging out with someone i need to find some common ground just like teddy said i have taken lately to talking with people on yeah i wa brought up in a left leaning family that always emphasised making our own mind up and freedom of opinion consequently im very left leaning while one of my brother is right leaning and gnudung reading what you wrote i think you need to watch the le mainstream movie two of the three you list that youve seen this year are major blockbuster which by definition pander to the yep thats all it all i need to do because there are very few time when i dont understand where my emotion are coming from generally my emotion arent what i need to figure out in order to almost always left there are probably a few issue where i lean right but they dont tend to be the one that are important to me so if it came to vote for the left person who cover most of my even a a female i do this too i have been accused of being cold by people who dont know me because i will never let my emotion out to people who dont deserve them a to your question i basically floated through my first year of university got a shock when i failed a couple of paper then a chose second year paper that interested me and b learned that i couldnt cruise the it depends on the topic with lighter more casual topic i tend to write a i speak and my blog is a bit difficult to follow because of this tendency but if it something deeper or i want to ive been reading this thread with interest since it started and i agree with this were seeing an almost textbook example of the type of miscommunication that can occur between these two type yeah like the others have said pay rent on time and do your share of the chore even if you hate them your own room if it separate can be a messydisgusting a you like but any shared area doctor who mostly thats the only one i really hang out for but others i also watch are big bang theory grimm project runway america next top model cant help it with those two i just my best advice is to take one of those interest and think of a present that relates for example with the art get an art book related to the art she like to look at or if she like to create art the one intj i know is really good at playing devil advocate and i appreciate him for helping me learn to look deeper at all side of a topic before deciding what my opinion on it is for me to get into my inner world take time i dont share who i am at my deepest with just anyone and even in a relationship it take a long time to get to know who i really am my advice if you mine is a building in my city that wa extensively damaged in a big earthquake year ago i chose it because i always loved it in there we are still not allowed back to the building and likely i wa like you with my kid i had routine that i did to signal to them when it wa bed time or bath time or feed time or whatever but they were never rigid nor were they at the same time each if you could anthropomorphize yourself into an animal would animal would represent you id like to say a cat but i suspect id be some sort of really clingy dog i hate dog though so maybe he wa to good too nice too everything i think i wanted to slap him this is possibly a lot to do with it being a long time since i saw his movie and that i hated the avenger on the other i spend a lot of time at home but if im not there ill be at the local park a library a coffee shop a bookshop at the movie theatre or sitting around reading at the beach ugh really i havent watched in a while but i absolutely loathe movie captain america especially in the avenger i wonder why i usually feel quite a happy affinity to character generally typed ive only watched one and a half of the video but it really interesting teddy you are so adorable i really liked the way both of you interacted together and im really itching to watch the isfjs tend to be the nurse caregiver etc and are generally in the background you dont often find them in main character role they will sometimes be the shoulder to cry on sidekick for the teddy im sorry if this is hijacking your thread but ive been mulling over what youve said here and im a little confused on one point if you suggest that we need to allow fe to dominate im married to an enfp and one of my best friend is one i adore them they are the only type i ever get a feeling about before becoming friend everyone ive been immediately drawn to and this part is something you could work at on a weekly basis teddy once youve run out of fun thing to do youll have to start getting more creative which will push you a bit out of your comfort butting in to say vertigo is one of my favourite hitchcock you should definitely watch it at some point my other favourite one is north by northwest hitchcock to me is so much more it wa in the ninety when i wa at university and it wa shown at the local arthouse cinema several time over many year actually oh the brilliant time i had in that place sigh the thing bobtoeback i love a clockwork orange i wonder if why i found it better than you did first time around is because i saw it on the big screen it very compelling on the large screen ive

At the moment I think you get at least 1/2 to 2/3 of a prop.'",ive never thought of starting a dream journal ive never really held any interest in dream i forget them almost immediately and dont feel any worse for it ive also been pretty weirded out so recently ive been thinking of starting a journal to try to organize my thought a bit maybe i wont spend so much time in my own thought im not sure what to expect i have always been a bit im not entirely sure this question will make sense but what do you feel is your best tool in connecting with people such a being able to easily sympathize or relate to people or your honesty oh man a debate on religion based around a loaded question about atheism always fun stuff a for myself i try to live by my own value if thats not enough for god x or y than i can live yeah i understand this fairly well a it a bit of a problem for me a well a for more question what are some thing you do for recreation when youre alone and what are some thing you do you have any trouble expressing your emotion and if so how do you manage angerresentment in your daily life also what are your top favorite musiciansbands aaron whats worse thinking youre being

stuff demon day also ha some very nice track city of god would be a lovely selection i would love to watch that movie again no i rarely like to discus myself much le my personal feeling i couldnt really nail down a specific reason why i dislike it so much except that i have a problem relying on people or asking thats so gay im sorry for thing that arent my fault man up or any equivalent be a man nut up etc everything happens for a reason any kind of sweeping generalization going to have to disagree the stand and harry potter and the deathly hallows are in my opinion both great example of good book with bad ending not really sure i know how to answer that question i obviously have nothing to compare it to it just who i am i suppose a lot of the trait of isfj might be seen a typically feminine but i dont know how to do them they are so mystifying someone please explain to me how mention like zanimus work eh my crippling introversion isnt well suited to hanging out with the cool crowd never ha been however i would like to inquire a to your supposed delight at seeing an isfj male in the i wa let in by mistake i think you need tighter security at the door unsure dishonesty and disloyalty i can usually maintain eye contact with close friend very well bordering on a somewhat weird stare but i will try not do this so much if i feel it make them uncomfortable a it doe with a few im very put off by the idea of marriage not for me at all on the other hand i feel now like i would very much like to have a child but honestly it too early to really be thinking much ive been told i have a very witty sense of humor and around my close friend i am usually more silly than serious however i would agree with the general trend of being very serious with an couldnt agree more the selfflattery in the op is also quite astounding they also use every diversionary tactic conceived to back up their completely bogus claim before the thread completely are you seeking a romantic relationship or do you actually just want a friend you can connect with on a personal level with all kind of pressure on people to seek sexual relationship it seems whats this about teenager comparing themselves with middleaged adult im and i still feel like an adolescent child and rightfully so at time laughing my favorite movie would probably be either goodfellas or reservoir dog though im not at all a violent person tongue i find both battle royale and the hunger game to be good story with absolutely horrible ending a for typing katniss i would agree with the istp prediction people have made

classify adele or lana del rey but it not usually my cup of tea wink youve got me disappointed all over again i enjoyed the first the second and third not so much im currently reading the second artemis fowl not sure how i feel about them right now not really my style i especially loathe dubstep but ill support anything that take attention off lady gaga in my opinion symbiotic power are more interesting and give way to more plot development later on in the story a perfect example would be venom from the spiderman universe mm ekac i have yet to really explode from keeping so many feeling to myself but im becoming increasingly worried that i might i understand what you mean about not knowing whether their concern is i seem to have this problem whenever i am faced with a confrontation or hurt feeling i dont bring it up i just try to push it away and forget about it im aware this is by far the healthiest way thats funny i also find myself having conversation with imaginary version of people i know maybe this is somewhat common im also completely obsessive so if an idea or song grab me ill be id like to add something to this but this post pretty much sum everything i could have
