to how i appear i feel like this sort of arises from being alone so much i dont really tend to get into relationship for no reason so i tend to be rather picky an ideal relationship would be a wonderful smart he not completely to my taste but his character are very interesting are we do you relate with this people tend to tell me im quite infj and im which is rather funny i feel if youre an infj you knowt wheras an enfj can be quite introverted at time and scientific sympathetic blithe humorous fairy pardon this is the opposite for me when i watch tv program i feel so much secondhand emotion i may cry infp sound very right i get a huge amount of ni dominance from you theyre all extremely beautiful i would be most likely to wear the wave palette yes definetely she almost ha that fake it till you make it way about her and is very talented and aware of it but she doe seem a though she is someone who us many persona also i lovely actress i thought i saw enfj in her but i could be wrong she might operate on nife though youtube ive all of a sudden had a huge revelation about lea michele and think that she could be an introvert she seems to have that sort of forward image and friendliness that a very well adjusted any more opinion o no i understand i wa just wondering what made it different so we could maybe decide in term of those type i highly doubt she pose fi and that she is not an se dominant it not off base thank you very much enfp and infp are the same function but in different order in term of if belle is an extrovert or an introvert her being extremely unhappy with the life that she life in the town and wanting right but why very true they also seem to interact more like entj and esfp rather than estj and esfp ni tends to take a lot of thing and bring them together into fully fledged idea i always thought tianas view for her resturant wa very ni but i could also be wrong i also think naveen is not at all she wa always looking towards the future and using what wa happening around her in order to propel herself towards the future she wished to achieve of course her father wa the guiding i always saw that at her using seni shes comfortable with making plan and embarking on the journey it will take to get to that plan but it is not a though she is content with her routine surely shes an entj o why oh well you surely deserve to feel very proud of yourself you are an amazing human being i really hope youre having an okay time you are so welcome shes a wonderful actress i think shes reserved when shes on camera even then she isnt really so reserved shes bubbly and quiet but not necessarily completely energized by herself she also wa involved in shouting gatsby surely operates on fe and lack ti id say she wa an esfj hahaha thats very true i could see him a having dominant fe though however doe he lack si i dont know perhaps his planning could come out in thing like his whole tirade against harry isnt he an esfj shes also in elementary and is absolutely great in that yes definetely well xnfj can be charming enfj are called suave often but it in an extremely different way she ha that sort of se in the moment charm rather than that enfj i feel for you and well it the same function but in a different order in term of just dominant function she doesnt really seem to be anything but a se dominant to me she ha all of these hobby fencing i think you absolutely nailed it on the head his whole i shall make joke because theyre funny to me is just so enfp why not i am a massive fan shes not an enfj or an infj she strike me a an estp alright i shall check those thing out thank you thank you so much for replying no that is not me thats lynda carter who is extremely gorgeous i agree i wa thinking it could be fe sort of overexposure to feeling or something how would you like to be helped or comforted a an estj dear reckless summer night we at the enfj forum love you just the way you are completely i am so happy you

personalitycafe if youd like to read it i can still see alec a an istj but his fi seems le i if you get what im saying despite the awful way of phrasing jace is so corny on the tv show it like an even cheesier quotefor the infernal device one of the series where i liked every mentioned character above something like that rarely happens tessa i have seen theory for her being infj and infp i think that the tv series shadowhunters character are very different from the book character clary book isfp tv esfp jace book estj tv istp simon book intp tv enfp alec jane eyre infp w w w not sure about the order mr rochester unhealthy enfj or entx w w w mr reed estj john reed estp eliza reed istj georgiana reed esfp m temple estj hey i have been reading the legend trilogy by marie lu and i wa interested in your opinion on the character type here what i think day isfp or infj in the beggining he seemed for atticus infj scout xnfp jem esxj my opinion changed from one to another a lot calpurnia esfj boo radley isfp bob ewell istp dill harris infp miss maudie esfj aunt ted i agree with captain mclain he seems to vary from infj to isfj w w w lily she us fe she manipulates people using fe and fe excuse for her behavior i am not offending her she is what do you think about rose i absolutely loved her i think she is extp but im not sure harvey entj w w w sxsp mike infp w w w spsx jessica entj w w w spsx louis istj in a sifi loop w w w spsx donna enfj the way she read people just seem like a i still see her a more of an fe user her occasional bluntness and the fact that that she hide her feeling dont instantly make her tedom take blair waldorf for example she can be really blind the scenario do influenciate the behavior but amongst all of the girl spencer is the one who seems to be the most worried about solving thing and staying safe even when they are in danger the annie esfj silver enfp adrianna unhealthy enfj she us nise when plotting naomi esfx honestly i can see reason for both ivy isfp navid enfj dixon i dont really see enfj i think i agree with livind dead about ali being w she also gave a pretty good explanation why i do think ali ha somewhere on her tritype but is surely not her first one the same go for spencer i agree with most of it based only on impression id say tyler is istp ian is a feeler but i see him a more xxfj i agree on keegan being nf but he say he is super outgoing and open about hey what do you think of cece now im guessing unhealthy enfj all she wanted wa to be loved and accepted and her obsession over the girl seems like a projection of her loneliness and now ashley benson estp troian bellisario infj shay mitchell esfx most likely esfj lucy hale isfj in contrast to hanna esfp spencer entj emily isfj and aria ixfp i agree guillermo a an isfp make incredible sense oscar wa indeed very stereotypical nowadays they just want to throw the broken rebellious boy everywhere i agree that he is an se user and hey ha anyone ever read ill give you the sun by jandy nelson thats such an nfy book what are your thought on the character type jude enfj noah infx sometimes i see fi no way isabelle is an entj first of all she is an si user she go by the book get mad at clary when she doesnt and also ha a hard time trusting others particularly boy because of what what were the diferences between intp and intj you read about annabeth intj w or w i can see both w w percy isfp he doesnt seem to use neither ni or te but his action are more fibased i can see esfp too w w w grover ixfp w w the two people im closest and tell everything to are my infj www best friend and my intj www brother i think ni doms make amazing friend with whom i can be myself with and get me i usually got more fi than fe from her a well what do you think about her father type i think he is very inspiring a well hey i have been reading i am malala by malala yousafzai i read online she is an enfj and i can see why but her father ziauddin sound like the epitome of an enfj and i find it hard to believe i love phoebe too when she showed up and begged holden not to leave that got me balling my eye out i think she is hard to type functionwise because of her age but a soon a she saw holden in the first few page there are argument that are pretty much he is insensitive towards other people feeling he is smart and he make mean joke about t over f seriously fi can be yeah i realised i wa projecting myself into her after i posted my last post you were right now im sold on entj ok you convinced me on nise but when i compare her to the extjs i know and i hate doing this because people are much more complex but i am very close to extjs and they just pop into my i just dont see te in lydia in season and she is all about group harmony taking care of the pack connecting with that banshee from eichen house helping parrish undersatand who he is am i the only one who think the character personality changed from season on usually from intuitive to sensor aria wa originally written a infj maybe infp she wa very intuitive than i agree with exfp but im leaning more towards enfp i googled some of her quote and saw other interview by the way she seems to be very excited about coming up with new idea and having change john green usually writes about xnfx female and xntx male the fault in our star hazel infj she ha ni humor and she always put gu and her parentes before herself gu entp with well i didnt know there wa a book i only saw the movie and to be quite honest i think it wa average is the book worth it rosie most certainly esfj alex he wa very underdeveloped the only i also thought she wa ixfj at first but i wasnt sure about si x ni whereas i wa sure about her fe i think her dominant function would be more the most obvious one so i guessed exfj and not yes i also think calypso is very relateable and i had never thought about rachel dare but enfp fit her very well yes i also think calypso is very relateable and i had never thought about rachel dare but enfp fit her very well i agree cassie is more s than n and jake is istj of the best movie ever i agree celine is xnfp jesse seems enfj ohh and calypso i adore her it quite obvious she ha fe percy initial impression of her had fe written all over however im still torn between si and ni she seems to be very idealistic and what do you guy think about what i said about lydia oh thats right people myself incluided must have guessed infp beacuse he is clearly a fidominant and his emo tendency in season one are one of the infp steryotypes i agree i dont know how people think ross is intj all of the ni dominant i know crave to be different than anyone else and dont usually believe in everything because it is i dont know elena isfp damon estp stefan isfj caroline esfj bonnie isfj katherine entx i came convinced she wa entj but after reading some reply im torn lexi enfj alaric ixtx matt istj i agree that sj fit blair more than nf however i see her a esfj besides what ive previously said blair needed to be looked up to and admired and liked to have people around her she another thing i forgot to mention about blair is that she had a slike logic an enfj even when heshe hate someone and dislike something they did heshe try to see it from their point of oh and i thought better and i think maia is an istj instead of istp her first pov chapter wa all about how much she distrust and dislike attractive men because of her experience with her well jace is very stuck on the past in his pov chapter he is constantly reliving his time with valentine and the very beggining of his life with the lightwood and comparing those experiencies

coin though i think there should only be good thread haha i took that pic though come to think of it it pretty much a standard pose for me too cool thanks ok here my eye this wa taken last monday night at a houseboat party photobucket that suck not sure if it make me an enfp but this thread made me play salsa music and dance around my bedroom lmao holy moly i had absolutely zero intention of coming off a self righteous quite honestly i shrink from the comparison it way too heavy for me to handle im not religious at all spiritual how do you do it ive taken like shot and they all look terrible do you just crop a pic of your whole face or what mine are blue plus im all puffy from being out all night i get annoyed but i understand that it a two way street i texted a coworker twice last night no response i wa annoyed and eventually got in touch with someone else funny thing is my hug everyone in the thread i love you guy oh man i had a nice response typed up but it disappeared in a server timeout doh lullabyblossom have him take the test again the result are notoriously inaccurate my first time i tested thanks thats pretty much what i wa getting at im exactly where im supposed to be happy not a morning person at all though it not like i wake up sullen or anything i just prefer to gradually drift upward into consciousness rather than be forced into it by an alarm alarm clock had a little moment today with the same chick i cried with on tuesday neither of u broke down since we were at work but it wa close lol a couple night ago i got into it with someone at i had trouble finding my career because my value are not the value of the world i went to school for roughly five year though not always full time eventually to me it seemed stupid to go action speak louder than word my friend where is this change we were supposed to believe in no offense and if this is crossing far enough into politics a to be unacceptable then i will delete it but obama is absolutely not an enfj bailing out the banksters from wall street on the back ive been going through this recently it only been the last couple day when ive actually been able to be myself around her a for why it happens i think it ha to do with our innate desire agreed in my work situation coworkers will come to me with a gripe or whatever because im more in tune with their emotional need and feeling so ill act a the mediator and go to the entj on jealous i want to hook up with the entj i work with shes effin awesome thanks im sore all over wow i think my entire left side is one big bruise i cried time today once when i saw my female enfj friend be wonderful to someone it wa so touching next when that same friend said something wonderful to me we both cried both time and i need to have a couple drink so i can think ashamed hell no were some of the most wonderful human being the world ha to offer bad sterotypes are derived from interaction with unhealthy enfjs you know when you see another enfj commit some random act of love are overwhelmed by the beauty in that person choke up tell them that they are wonderful then they get overwhelmed choke up and absolutely but particularly between enfjs and entjs were yin and yang i cry mostly listening to music though if i read something truly inspirational ill break down but anyway it love that get me all choked up maybe a better word would be yearning or longing exactly and they can learn a thing or two from u a well did anyone happen to catch the eulogy of the john wooden what word did they use selflessness loyalty drive humility relationship integrity love the very best coach in the world are all photobucket word im in love with one she try to act heartless but i can see right through that crap get a healthy enfj to say it for you selene i signed up specifically to say thank you for your wonderful post needle to say it wa a rather stunning revelation to be told by someone ive never even met that the person ive been

but thats a digression my experience with infjs ha been that sometimes they jump to i love jazz but i really like more of the s soul influenced stuff that ha been sampled in alot of hip hop and house music if your interested in listening to some really jazz influenced hip the infj girl is cute holla shortay lol a for the eye contact thing maybe it wa the presence of the camera that contributed a well i tend to make direct eye contact when im listening in lift weight interval train and do muay thai atleast day a week people who cant focus or pay attention i did with the only person i ever loved i think it wa more obsession then anything she broke up with me like the next day but i dont think she ever found out if i cheated again i would never yes you need to ask yourself who why and how a well a what to see if these conspiracy are logical why would a group invest energy in creating chemtrails who is this group what vested interest how can anyone bring an intelligent argument to the table also what purpose would it serve when the party requesting an intelligent argument are the one that refuse to acknowledge basic science heh out of all the people ive datedhad sex with i only had one serious relationship and it ended many year ago my personality type wa enfj and hers wa infj which shouldve ment that we were reading that make me want to off myself ive gone through that myself what have you tried to do to get out of your depression pm me if you want enfj i love who i am yo son why you shrugging all the time you got innanet tourette or something why would you be lonely you look fly a a mufcka shortaaay anyway hi glad to meet you i have had friend who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder i can say without a doubt that it ha had a tremendously negative effect on their life both mentally emotionally and materially in term very much so i have developed a way of coping that is almost buddhist in it philosophy i have cultivated an understanding that life is unfair and full of disappointment and suffering within that ive always loved infjs for their depth value and personality i have dated a few and i have never had the level of intense emotional and sexual intimacy with anyone since the problem is everyone i m all about mutual pleasure i love pleasing my lover but hell no it not difficult for me to lay back and get some head i love that shiet no offense but i think you may have to develop some additional maturityself confidence before you can have a successful relationship start worrying about yourself more then this guy

those who dont reciprocate or show any appreciation for what youve given be it time compassion or a favor this only happened to me when i wa in younger yes type w and im a perfectionist so i compete with everyone around me and with myself to always be the best that i can beand that better be a close to perfect a possible this is manifest aquc thats strange ha sorry you guy just keep reminding me about thing here and there what i love about my istps are that they are the most descriptive complimentors one of them doe so yes my istp doesnt know about myers briggs and showed only passing curiosity but he explains himself to me so well when i ask the right question this is probably the hardest thing for me to when stressed ive been told it physically manifest itself a taughtness all over i move rigidly more quiet and le expressive my friend usually know that the second i stop talking or asking a shame indeed there always residency you never really know where youll end uphooray i

openly im a control freak myself although not a neat freak it help to tell your so that it i would think the behavior you describing to be uncharacteristic of enfj he is either intimidated by you or just doesnt like you for whatever reason best case scenario he is under the impression i do love tradition and created some of our own a i got older and so did our child we became more lax with tradition especially if they require a lot of effort but we follow some being married to intj for year yes they get jealous basically they are very loyal people and dont understand being scattered in relationship that said my intj know when im joking sorry double post yep several time a few with my thenfuturehusband a well i cant recall detail of any of them but i do remember this distinct feeling of certainty that this is how it going to be and later excellent question i get stuck in both once in a while probably equally i actually learned to recognize ni ti pretty well so i can cut out of it fe se still give me trouble just that im not comfortable at all ha i will thanks music nothing physical actually so cloud nine yes but nothing that is driving me insane no i dont a long a there are no hole in that logic of course i love dark humor doe this count happy there are some dark thought too i do have a role and a purpose but i dont think they necessarily define me or at least none of them define me fully i think the giver description resonated well however some other this is the only question that i dont really understand what doe it mean to have a strong sense of identity i think so i believe in the good of humanity i am striving to do no harm and what do you need to know ill answer this is very helpful i very much prefer oneonone conversation but i trained myself to be inclusive when im in a large group that said i would never willingly put myself in a big group ive usually tested a enfj but the older i get the more introverted and introspective i get i also have very strong ni probably a the result of living with intj for year my fe is there it wont break her if there is something else big she is getting out of the relationship do you connect mentally is there some strong emotion you can share an interest or hobby in common that she im married to intj and i dont think that lack of initiation is something that is specific to intjs especially sexual initiation my intj never had an issue with it for you i have one advice i feel that if i had to explain my career choice through my personality characteristic then my enneagram w ha more to do with it than my mbti interesting recently i started thinking can you explain what doe my enfjness have to do with this oh yes this intj told be multiple time he doesnt trust people with thing important to him and doe everything himself i guess i should follow his example well it exactly that it not something i could entirely myself but i can hire help instead of relying on a friend really i think it wa a stupid idea on my part sad thanks a very good advice i actually never gave him a timeline but gave him a way out multiple time he kept saying he would do it i think he just didnt realize the help i asked about is more than he thought it haha my example isnt real and im a pc gal i reminded once and two week later my friend promised me hed get back to me in the next week or so he said that on his own accord without me even let say a friend asked for your help for example you know a lot about electronics and a friend asked you to help pick out a computer you keep saying youll send them a list of model that are if you promised something but then didnt deliver what could be the reason i apologize if im intruding in the intj thread but wouldnt it be fair to say that you also want him le than your freedom of not having kid and being married im not saying this is right or parenting is hard i dont really know how to answer this and also there may be a multitude of reason i generally like knowing how people close to me are doing then i can offer support or simply make them feel good yes i want to be updated your second question is harder what do you mean by care a lot you dont have to be my person for me to want to be updated on your life for example here is my i love to cook but i detest cleaning the house my house is messy but our dinner and especially dessert are always good i

what you hope to hear but here my thinking maybe he got embarrassed by your compliment but it not hard for enfj to understand what i used to work at the same place a my husband same team same bos i started first then there wa an opening that he wa perfect for and he got hired i wa told the company wa wary of never thought about it this way i thought it just me im always questioning everything should i send you some old spice the general rule of thumb is not to do it unless one of you can afford to quit the job also you need to be sure the other person is not a jerk doesnt have to turn out to be the one but if whats your relationship to this enfj a good one will easily sense your limit and protect you from overload see below im enfj married to intj ive been protecting him from social life i know what you mean when usa had several ebola case in there wa this pretty real not fictional dr brantly who caught the disease in africa but survived he wa given some plasma not if they are talking about plasma donation blood transfusion blood group and compatibility no it even worse the people i see in the office are all part of a different team the one im not working with at all so all the interaction is maybe in the kitchen while pouring some fwiw one intj once told me that i wasnt the kind of girl one fall in love with right away but the more he got to know me the more he liked me

introverted a i am getting older i realized last week that for once in my life i wa i think i would be more shocked than annoyed if i realized the friend is trolling ill probably laugh it off if the friend wa serious ill ask whats all this fuss about i love esfjs i love how they are caring loving kind and fun to hang out with i seem to click with them very well compared to other type probably because i am a enfj which make u quite similar no way all of the esfjs i know are actually quite smart efficient and organized not really i usually only think and care about those who are the most memorable to me for instance people who i find interesting inspiring nice outgoing and easy to talk to i dont really i dont know about other enfjs but i always reply back to message especially if i said i would otherwise i would feel bad i cant give you a clear answer but when i am around someone i am attracted to i tend to get very nervous to the point where i cant say the right word and become a little ditzy have you ever i get tired after talking or hanging with friend for a long period of time i need to have time to myself to reflect on thing and to recharge however being alone for too long can make me feel i think i am just nervous due to the crush sometimes i hesitate to speak my mind because i am scared of what he think unlike others he seems disinterested or emotionless sometimes which make it whoop double post wish there wa a delete button somewhere yes i agree with everything you wrote it almost a if youre me o lol thats what i thought too when i saw your post were both in the same situation laughing what do you guy think of people who get nervous around you ever since i became really attracted to this infp guy i went from being really sociable to being really quiet towards him i get really wow this is all pretty true for me too i dont think enfj woman get ignored from my experience ive dated the guy i liked yes that sound exactly like her some of the tendency i have that she would not have are when i am upset about something it would not take me long to discus about it if people were to i used to have a infj best friend and i would notice the main difference between u is shes a perfectionist and would claim she ha ocd tendency like what iamken said about his friend my im a w the loyal friend w w i can relate to how you feel a ive just recently been through the same thing i think u enfjs tend to think a lot too and that our feeling can really mess u up to the point where we would have haha even though i am not a infp i tend to edit my post a lot too thank goodness there a edit button congrats i am so happy and excited for you now if only i can find myself a infp guy anyways hope you will update more about this a i would love to read more about how compatible these are finished with an exam today and now i got to try to stop slacking off haha im not surprised because personality type is such an interesting topic same go for me when it come to falling in love quickly and falling out of love slowly infact i still miss him right now and it suck that he doesnt talk to me like he used to anymore same go for me infact i still miss him right now and it suck that he doesnt talk to me like he used to anymore sometimes it just suck how it is so hard for u to move on i hope you will one day it would be nice to know someone who can understand and relate to you piece of pizza vegetarian mozzarella and the other one wa full of meat pickle and sour cream chip and fruit piece of honey dew orange and slice of banana talk about unhealthy yep i agree because it feel good to get stuff off your mind and confronting problem will lead to a better understanding of each other too however depending on the situation it can be hard to haha i wouldnt mind being your friend too on perc i guess it because there are misunderstanding and that we dont really talk it out with each other by the way i am pretty sure my really best friend is an entj he just awesome even though haha i love researching about topic too currently interested in personality a you can see a for fitness it ha been such a huge for me since last year i exercise like almost everyday and i wouldnt mind being friend d my best friend so far are isfp isfj istp intj and either entj or entp i cant tell but we all get along really well with each other and can talk about anything for hour a for love i would say or i need my alone time to think and recharge lol after reading a lot of these i got to say you guy sound so nice and interesting too bad i dont know any infps in real life i wouldnt mind being friend the bolded part is true i have a male enfj friend and i cant imagine dating him because conversation becomes tiring hmmthis is a hard question since i really want both but i think i would rather be accomplished a in accomplishing my life goal because i will probably be proud and happy afterwards when youre afraid that you have annoyed someone after talking so much when you feel surprised every time someone compliment you yeah i agree which is why i always wonder how my friend linked me to rukia because she just doesnt seem like the happy and positive type i guess it because back then i used to have an hair i agree there no holding back once our mind is set and from my experience it hard to stay friend with the person that ive been in a relationship with

want to just avoid everything and everyone and go and hide until im in enough emotional control of how i appear to other people i think you need to consider your methodology internet forum tend to be weighted towards night owl not just for sociological reason but also physiological one the light from a computer peter gilly happy about nothing your username is sad this video could make you happy youtube for my two cent i think ntjs and nfjs are similar in the tonight ha been quite a lonely strange sort of night much like the soft chord i strum out on the guitar each time i get here i dont feel im making much progress towards any kind of resolution what kind of rejection wa it explicit and romantic probably not if they just faded away into the background they might give you an explanation if you assure them it safe to do so talk and tea is such an easy way to snare xnfjs p especially with new people chat and tea feed our fe and se in a really pleasant way also the combination of intimacy and relaxing tea make it this isnt really related to type there is a strong bias against multiple partner in most culture and an even strong bias against lying to people and hurting their feeling in pretty much all of in term of what im all about my main train of thought are usually to do with observation about the people around me and how they feel or trying to work out how i am appearing how i am being me and bae on choir tour in the usa a month or two ago it me on the left unfortunately some of the girl in choir find taking picture of u really amusing because he inch taller than meeehhh i feel like my head is full of sand and i cant think straight just missed a deadline big time and i dont really care because what is actually on my mind is a girl who i cant figure out ive played various instrument i often give them up if i feel like im never going to be amazingly good at them right now im focused on singing im good enough that sometimes i get paid but sometimes im very aware of my ni processing a i keep following a train of thought often ill catch myself wondering something like how would i describe the people around me in sentence how i am generally open with my friend and loved one when i think theyre doing something stupid some of them take it well some people month later still dont treat me a before and probably never baking for people always make me feel warm inside and m dough smell i very much can be if i think someone making a big mistake sometimes im wrong about it often im right but i forget that stuff like that is much more of a disaster for someone hyper conscious i would actually say that typically enfjs can struggle a bit to pinpoint their feeling fe is concerned with the outer world of emotion the emotion of other people surface expression such a ever feel like youre in a bubble when youre with a group or behind thick glass apparently sylvia plath likened her depression to being in a bell jar a container with nothing inside oh loneliness hit me like a freight truck sometimes it not just the frequency of social interaction that enfjs enjoy i think were also hyper sensitive to the quality of our social interaction i like to have at least one day or a few evening to myself in a week with the phone off doing my thing not exactly new but never introduced myself what fuck me up in a bad way everything i tell myself i should be or should be doing what fuck me up in a good way seamus heaney poetry playing c oh i very much have this problem enfjs make everyone feel loved and understood a for the most part we do love and understand unfortunately people dont realise that enfjs are really aware of is it too much to ask that someone could fucking know me least of all me i think the existence of a page thread is fairly good evidence were hard to read both xnfjs are well known a being emotional fort knox that feni or nife combination mean in practice that we thats cool to think about i want intimate close deep relationship with everyone that i decide to like but not at the cost of being vulnerable i actually hold quite a lot of people deliberately id join some painfully bad amateur hockeyrugbysoccer team in term of feeling instantly connected to people sport and music particularly singing are definitely the best yahh i wa just thinking about this an hour ago and realised i totally mangled that feni is still a strong combo for verbal reasoning i think people dont see it that way usually because fe is enfjs have a dispostion towards great verbal reasoning and debating skill in their cognitive function nite help you to analyze and break down the argument of other people and structure your hey there ive not found it easy to type myself forced dichotomy test are often not that helpful because i associate with both side of the spectrum like i said i find i instinctually mediate sometimes it not a obvious a that enfjs can hold themselves to high standard because they think they are obligated to do it because of their superiority enfjs can also appoint themselves a i wonder if im the only enfj here who actually avoids relationship i like sex and intimacy and being close to people but my experience of being in romantic relationship ha been one of it not like i need people to tell me im great but if people are clear they want me around that make me pretty happy and then if you let me cook for you im humming p unhealthy enfjs get preoccupied with being marginalized because of their unique capability and talent with a not unremarkable dose of paranoia enfjs could easily do the wrong thing if they think xnfjs are rarely inclined to be open because they feel there are thing about them or thought they have that are undesirable or not useful in the current social context so just get suppressed and oh yeah enfjs draw people in through their natural warmth they seem to love everyone in part because they act like they do and mask their true feeling if they really dont like someone enfjs tend to experience their internal emotion from an oblique angle they take u by surprise almost i listen to a song and suddenly remember i listened to that song a lot during a tough period probably enfj is my feeling enfjs get shy when theyre not sure of how they should act especially s i think this something people underestimate about u especially enfjs with a bit of enneagram hovering around in their enneatype enfjs can be spiteful but our agression usually manifest oh dear lord im bored of keeping it together for everyone enfjs are manipulative but it perhaps too strong a word for what they do enfjs modify their behaviour and public persona to be more successful in a given environment of course success depends ahaha they do exist but all of the ni type are rare and the feni one can be hard to spot because they adapt their behaviour to their surroundings so the male can look a bit different to the i get the impression you guy are young like most of the people on this site by young i mean ish ish ish it really depends young or immature enfjs are much more unsettled in term of i totally feel you shelk fe is both crappy at introspecting and wonderfully externally inconsistent with our need to fe mask at everyone so keeping it real get very tricky especially for u ahaha not at all surprised to see an enfj enjoying that game i know i get a kick out of anything where i can make a selfrepresentative character and then go do good in the world and forge a lot of enfjs especially younger one arent really sure who they are we are generally focused on other people to the extent that we can be a bit of a mystery to ourselves in the process of i can point out that this question is philosophically flawed for instance because theyre an elephant would be a valid answer youre asking for negative definition any characteristic that i might think the person ha decided they dont want me around and back off or id feel hurt that this person rejected me and cut them off equivalently it odd but thats how i deal with hey all im currently going through the process of a possible add diagnosis ive been a daydreaming nonstop talking walking bubble of chaotic disorganisation forever and now i go to one of more than possible skill are thing you are constantly learning and practising and socialising is no different for most of the time i wa growing

been getting frustrated with me because i wont state the answer which is why he stated it for me he been trying to get me to admit it to him for a few month now i think he wa just aww thanks for your kindness it much needed i just feel like it so hard to express myself and my emotion which is why im drawn to this infj he understands and know without me having to ive read some about mbti im going to research it more i am pretty much stuck in my extroverted feeling though i would even go a far to say that i dont care about my feeling at all i haha yeah my infj friend and i get along well but he like my kryptonite i know that im good at manipulating situation and people feeling even though i only do it for the better to make ive been looking for information on how well an enfj and an infj would work together in a relationship but i couldnt find much anyone have insight outgoing social yes attention seeking not really i dont seek attention i give it emotional loving of course i love everyone organized in most aspect however im not very tidy at home exactly take a bully for example why are they mean to people maybe thats how they were raised maybe they didnt have loving parent or maybe they have really low self esteem and they feel like i struggle with those thought daily ive just came to the realization that not everyone know how to be a good person i think that most people have good intention and want to be happy they this reminds me so much of my experience my mother however wa never supportive it going to take him time to adjust to who he is a a person it so tough growing up a an enfj it difficult you should include that in your introduction then lol im sorry for being abrupt the other day my name i forgive people when they apologize she probably will too lol id also say something about having a drink sometime coffee or alcohol whatever if shes talked to you before then shell probably text you haha ummm you could try that but id say something like hey ive seen you here a few time my name xxx whats yours and then after her reply tell her that you dont have a lot of hmm thats difficult to say i like to make all people feel comfortable and this tends to come off a flirting to others but to me im just being me it take a long time for me to cultivate a haha your post are hysterical i cant speak for all enfjs but when i talk to people im usually trying to get a feel for them their expression gesture body language it easier for me

and lost than to have never loved at all shakespeare for me the most powerful sign of showing i care for someone is a heartfelt note written just for them i dont often use my time for such thing but the people who truly matter the most get ready for a lot of conflict but if youre both willing to grow it can work i can tell you now youre going to unintentionally hurt her feeling by being direct and unemotional shes going to so what if he doe sex is fun relax i definitely dont consider intellectually connecting with someone cheating in even the slightest form though i will say it get tricker from a trustjealousy standpoint if it with someone of the yeah im quite similar sexuality for me is almost synonymous with amount of love in the relationship or bond in general it may not be the case that she love me any le and i get the feeling if she wa just always like this id most certainly move on for the sanity of u both but since she hasnt always been and doe seem interested in returning to her former and more normal sex let say that the open part of the relationship happened could that fix thing for me potentially but ive never done it and i know im a bit of a jealous person so i dont think id be she hasnt been on birth control since she had problem many month ago before we met stress wise she ha been eliminating thing and subsequently thing have gotten better since the worst part oops i dupe replied and it wont let me delete this post ive long since realized i dont and shouldnt feel bad for that some people just have different need expectation in life nothing wrong with that and sex is a natural part of being human so i did this once in a past relationship it wa the most awful thing ive ever done it tore u apart and ultimately ruined a year relationship suffice to say after all that pain and suffering id sigh sorry to hear this i feel your pain the hardest part about dealing with it me honestly ha been that because her sex drive is gone she doesnt even see a need or reason to change to her is a bit closer to what i averaged in my last relationship it felt perfect and i never thought to myself that im unsatisfied to the countrary our sex life wa exciting adventurous frequent while that may be great for some people it absolutely unacceptable for me even other form of sex such a blow job doesnt do it for me to each their own id never criticize someone for not aelthwyn basementbugs ive spoken with my so about it and she said it not because she doesnt find me attractive or doesnt find it enjoyable she just isnt much in the mood she also admits she so i know this isnt really an enfj thing but i like to think of you guy a folk who know how i think so why not ask these sort of question here what are your typical expectation of enfjs definitely have a problem giving constructive feedback the wantneed to avoid conflict can make it particularly hard to criticize even if it in the other person best interest ive yeah ive definitely done that a few time it take a moment of extreme frustration to bring me to that moment ill either take it out on a wall door or something usually hard it only i have a sort of all or something policy for lack of a better way of saying it i have a few very close very personal connection that i covet more than anything and many many acquaintance and a i gave up a long time ago giving a shit what others think of me i know im different and downright effeminate in certain regard but people who find that off putting or dont like it arent really i love that way of distinguishing j v p i definitely project my moral and feeling on others to a fault it seems like almost though i always feel like i do it because i think im right and alfreda and seeker much like kc i too have gotten upset to the point of physically acting out but i would never ever touch a significant other it take a truly fucked up person to do that i i think you should reread what i said again i dont think he trying to blame you by using your mbti type against you i think he trying to tell you that he responds better to an emotional i think several people in here have given some good advice so id like to back some of it up and maybe offer a bit of my own jakedk is right that you need to give him a bit of space if he im not sure precisely i suppose you can do some subtle test to try and and extract the type e v i youll know if theyre an e just based on their social life do they like to go out or stay oh no a in being scared youll ruin the relationship if you focus on that aspect you will in fact ruin it the fun will get sucked out of the relationship because youre more concerned with not funny you mention that thats often how i feel in a relationship it end up becoming a self fulfilling prophecy though if you focus on it trust me i dont really think there a trick to attracting u i suppose you either come across one or you dont you need to be a good judge of personality type and try to see if he a like enfj it being an enfj i seem more concerned with how others feel usually so im not much for being a sadist but i dont mind being picked on in a playful way so it work out pretty well if the other im not sure if im an outlier

so much of what i am figuring out is on my own just based on my observation because i am not getting the feedback i need from her so a lot of what i what if she resists having experience because she doesnt want to get attached i think it based on the premise that i will be leaving again for eg if i ask her to do something i may constantly hey thanks for taking an interest and for the support thing are going alright the last time we talked thing were great but i still do have an uneasy feeling because this is a relationship bluegiraffe glad it made you smile part of the reason i said it wa to make you smilei guess i wa flirting haha but a usual you are right about it complicating thing we dont need any first thing first you guy are awesome your honesty and getting down to the core of thing is so refreshing i find that this lack of honesty is what is missing in this world sometimes but thats blushed thanks bev thunder bev or anyone else any input blushed it seems like i keep coming back to this point with her a amazing a thing are she hasnt shown the effort to make the change even though it hey blue just wondering what you think i should do if she continues to ignore this suggestion for me that is a deal breaker it is a simple thing for someone to do and imo there is no reason youtube i flubbed a bit and sent some supportive message and kinda said a bit of what we talked about earlierto be honest i am so busy with my own life that i like to deal with these thing asap and update she didnt answer when i calledlol what a fail i guess ill back off again blue giraffe youre so fiesty it cute p add haha i if i wasnt in med school with barely enough time to sleepoh and post here from time to time maybe i would what do i get in it definitely a challenge making plan with her because ill be like let do this and shes like yeah but then the follow through is a disaster she realy doesnt plan ahead but it strange bev it a good sign that she is communicating her feeling towards you like that and another good sign that she got back in contact after needing space the fact that you obviously didnt all of you wow guy thanks so much for all the support and help i truly didnt expect this kind of response you girl are wonderful i am going to reply to your response individually so a thanks alot strange im usually very good with grammar i even use comma in the right place usually bah look at this you have me all grammar conscious now damn you that wa hahaim a selfimprovement junkieand she ha done more for my selfimprovement than anyone else i have had to become so much stronger because of this situation challenging me in way you thank you so much for your answer she ha acknowledged her feeling for me in word she ha said thing like you are the best thing that ha happened to me and other thing like that i haha an enfp would start a thread with thatill get to the point because otherwise i might lose half or all of you so i have been dating this istp girl for about monthsshe

enfjs in the family often make her of not finishing the thing ive started due to distraction example my novel my master degree my journalism career of being shackled by debt in this economy of being a bad friend of respect their space dont treat it like a college dorm do not leave a mess in their kitchen or trash in their vehicle do not show up unannounced and uninvited on their doorstep do not i take it back my infj friend just asked me to be his girl now im in a panic to research infjs all over again so i dont screw up shocked one sign an enfj like you is when they shoot you a laaawl ok you win i see some similarity with my infj buddy here he the only infj i know i thought he wa another type until he tested in group he come across a an e not an i when i only knew him on that well i find infjs fascinating so were even d what c said also it depends on who is giving it to me if i dont have a good connection to that person then a romantic gift is regarded with suspicion i will shove that gift into the depth of i really sympathize with you seeker twice in the past i accidentally and on purpose ended up dating or very involved with someone to try and placate myself when i wasnt getting the person i really i know i wa fighting this line of thinking all night tonight all day i wa looking forward to seeing this person and i got so worked up nervous trying to not gush and squee all over him i sorta im not the best person to answer this because im a control freak super perfectionist w but for what it worth a lot the thought sneak in until i write them down or rationalize and lol summery you just perfectly described the relationship between me and my current infj bestie his personality continually intrigue and confuses the heck outta me but you just described i agree one time i wa with another strong e type it wa like strapping myself to a roller coasterextreme high and low experienced at hyperspeed it started out addictive but got old fast i yep cuz i agree with this it seems to me that your friend is testing your boundary and trying to get a little attention from you or being a little bit dominating i think a comment such a the story so far are so interesting i believe the event that made me the most angry wa when a family friend and youth leader at our church committed suicide i remember the date it wa in daphne du maurier speculative fiction of all typesespecially isaac asimov and david weber lot of classic fantasy mystery and anything with a twist ending dickens shakespeare poetry nonfic do you have one you know a physical place you go to retreat from the noisy world and the demand of all the needy people around you last night i got back from a three day camping w the perfectionist yum yeah your buddy could put off your question indefinitely with vague or nice answer if he didnt appreciate you asking them so there probably isnt any reason to worry about being to aggressive i agree quite a bit with much of the above post not at all the love youre talking aboutpiano falling from the th floor on your head kind of love crazy shakespearian love obsessive musician hand soft rumbly voice kind and patient quirky selfentertaining

date with that guy went and whatnotit wa a no go after all on the night we were supposed to connect i started getting odd text from him he the fact that youre here for her now is probably more important than your having been out of the loop for a while at least shes eventually told you some of the stuff shes been going through even really granted ive met a lot of shy people online who arent cool with group but i never expected most people to be that way ive been in writing group in chatroom since i wa fourteen met wow i hear your frustration frustrating trouble recognizing when a guy

pretty much this when i demanded to be introduced two year ago nbd it wont change my opinion why is this a thing once he realized both how do tell im intrigued and happen to own an intp fire when ready this is adorable perhaps he wa also conflicted about why you two were having interaction like this typically if were curious were not shy about approaching someone but dont expect i cant speak for everyone so ill speak for myself what sign doe an enfj give away when attracted what do you do when youre attracted it depends on how much information i have about if you read your link youll see that the extinguishment partner of the infp is actually the enfp i love japanese literature is this something i should look into maybe we should share our favorite book too on that note one of my favorite is a novella by banana yoshimoto sometimes there an effect of being too wholesome that isnt an intriguing or challenging enough factor for young boy this will change a your friend get older tell her absolutely not to im going to say this a a word of caution online survey are the least reliable method of taking a poll two big reason you dont know if the person answering the question is who they this wa terrifying thank you for sharing shes beautiful

ensure everyone ha equal right enough basic necessity and are content d my best friend an infp and i absolutely love her with all my heartproud i only have good thing to say about her because she amazes me everyday haha she like to think the opposite though and istjs one of my best friend is an istjand boy he such a confusing person to me initially i admire your honesty ok youre not honest all the time when it doesnt serve your purpose or it ahh i love them fangirl alert why didnt i find this thread earlier ok for me personally i think zayns an infj because from many interview he is the most moodiest and like to go for walk i know this thread wa a while back but i just had to reply the list wa so accurate for me i wa like except the buying book part but really of what you wrote really represented yup all the time people get the imcontentedwithlife vibe from me apparently or so ive been told but it quite strange because i hurt so easily and become down quite often get lost in those yes yes yes yes yes haha i get along the best with infps my best friend is an infp i swear ive never felt a mch acceptance and connection with anyone else my brother is an infp and we too get gosh i could totally relate to this girl youre talking about hmm what i think though i may be mistaken is that whenever someone new come along in this case you and im really into him and hmm just had to reply to this i know this sound corny but i strongly believe that if you have to change yourself just so that someone would notice you then maybe that person isnt the right one just out of curiosity so sts are le likely to get into relationship with people theyre close to doesnt make much sense to me to be honest because dont you form a strong connection and bond sure errrfor me ive never really had him in a sense but i hope it still count hope this isnt too boring the one who got away would be my best friendwhom ive known since i wa and in since im quite new here thought id share a few thing about myself im currently waiting to enter universitycollege cross my finger that i get a place co it really competitve in my country thank you for yr invaluable advice i needed someone to tell me that and ill take your advice to heart having such authority all that youve described is something ive always envisioned in my hahaha so guility of this am slowly trying to stop this hmm i actually become uncommunicative mostly when ixm upset or angry but if someone upset others then i have no hesitation in haha omg i would be scared to death if i looked into the mirror and didnt see anything xd i think there wa a movie made about this right some invisible guy who wa the villain yes i do wish i wa invisble a lot of the time actually especially when im being subjected to unwarranted attention or the spotlight on me infront of people whom im not very familiar with and haha first time ranting here but i feel like im gon na explode if i dont im not a very political person but when such injustice is glaringly obvious and right in my face i get soo mad my bigwilly yea i mostly tend to avoid those im angry at too especially friend or those i care for instead of confronting the issue head on and this usually take a few day or week if it really definitely you sound like the complete opposite of me so i figure it ha nothing to do with personality type like you mentioned for me no one take me seriously because they believe im a exactly haha are you sure you didnt read my mind thats basically one of challenge i face the split personality thing i have to be strict to control them yet at the same time my first so it wa my first day at work today a a parttime teacher and i had to teach this class of misbehaved year old who were really rebellious picture a class of rebel put together and other love telling pun joke like these loving this thread me have you heard my butter joke dad errno me thats co i havent spread it xd same here the closer i am to someone the le guilty i feel in saying what i want directly but it still occurs very very rarely do you receive compliment well because for example if i top the summersault aww youre sweet definitely

towards me we dont really work together that much but whenever he see me he make conversation and is any thought would be appreciated happy not really i like the shy one and if anything want to keep them to myself rather than share the secret that is their awesomeness love inspires me being alive inspires me isnt that to an extent the same thing think about it or dont promethea i choked on my tea i noticed both here and irl that a lot of intps worry about the future and what happens if i do this and that which is great for planning and setting yourself up in the most beneficial position uncertain aw you guy are so macarons teeny weeny little cute flavoursome macarons like breakfast cereal macarons lol the ferrero rocher wa kind of a little joke between the enfjs i hope danieljamesmaher we eat them like crazy over here in the uk i respect someone more if they disagreed and called me out than if they silently disagreed and continued to form an unsubstantiated opinion of me the latter happens waaay more often than the former ahh my reasoning is that kitkats are your bog standard chocolate society most popular break bar and very much a staple in any scenario at least involving snack like an istj reliable no grandpa i meant to say information not irrelevant oops little pocket of knowledge which contribute to an overall network wa the best i could come up with

bit of that ha to do with being an enfj you dont have to feel useless nothing wrong with determining situation using feeling for me feeling become fact and im a teacher so i have somewhat of a basis and experience i think ive noticed esfps being quite good at reading people in the immediate moment but not understanding motif or the dynamic of ni istjintjs are surprisingly accurate too but they dont one day and i strongly believe it will be very soon you will realise that you should not have let me go and i will have moved on i find people with underbites really cute how about the classic i

for hitting woman sure though i dont think one should be ive had the same also it typically when im not in fun mode and getting to know someone new usually it happens after i ask them a question i dont say anything sometimes to let them go on thats creepy dont do that if you see her apologize to her and make a joke that way youll be friendly with her if thats your intention my friendship only go so far youve been misconstruing what ive said about trial one wonky case with medium involved doesnt illustrate the fact you know whats right and wrong well were dancing by this point my friend there not much that can be said that hasnt been already these arent that complex a situation the majority everybody must be considered both it not so much that there mistake it that these thing arent planned in advanced a mentioned earlier majority of the time a i said it a spur of the moment and lot of time having i wouldnt believe it necessary to have more than a handful of evidence you dont

anything like it here i do know we dont need to do everything together i this is helpful ill try to tell him that i think that he think he doesnt have that many impulse really but i dont believe that p it wa very witty wink we would have to take a bus to get to a hiking trail but that is a possibility we have talked going for a hike for half a day or a day and he seems up for that a long a it not winter we have hi so im trying to explain some about the tini loop and the role of se for my istp boyfriend he is all weirded out and say about a thread i linked this guy is proud he made a sandwich it will get better remember that she is putting you in this situation too so she is also responsible for your health hopefully you moving out will also reduce your stress and improve your mental yeah i know i have drifted apart from almost all of my old friend it how it work i guess but it sad hug i agree that it important and that speculating isnt really leading anywhere i have talked to him about it but i will try a bigger discussion about it im not home at the moment so ive used i agree it really tough i keep thinking how when i actually do get a really close female friend im gon na look back at this time and realize how much not having one wa getting me down it interesting that so many of u have the same experience with mother be strong and look out for yourself moving help a lot i moved hour away so she could only reach me fast on phone i think i know how you feel i wa best friend with an esfp for year and when i moved to another town to study and the friendship needed a little effort from her side she didnt do shit i wa im definitely a shy extrovert im usually shy with new people and can be awkward with people i dont know too well i find it easier to be social if im in some kind of role like if i need to be i dont know the theoretical explanation for it but it seems like sensing fuel judging a bit guessing it ha to do with sensor being more grounded and to a larger extent life in their sens whatever type you are you interest me if you are enfj with a somewhat complicated relationship to your fe you could use ti a a way to shield your emotion from others and from yourself dear istp boyfriend i more and more realize i have no idea what go on in your head it starting to freak me out i look forward to your next random blurt of thought sincerely with love i have had to learn to not invest fully in those who dont want to be helped my isfp mum is very needy in constant need of comfort and support but do not want to change i have tried many many if my partner isnt bringing up any consideration about the relationship that freak me out my istp boyfriend never really brings up any issue and i know we have our issue i bring them up so you are very welcome to use mbti a a game what you said though is that you know it more of a game i know there are trouble with finding empirical evidence for the function and i surely agree hi platena and welcome to perc it all sound pretty enfj to me i dont know where you read we are supposed to be good at expressing our feeling we have a tendency to be scared of asking for she sound like a lovely dog i too want a dog someday im adopting a second cat now since my other cat got lonely i agree that it heartbreaking to see them still showing you that they are happy ah damn if you feel there is still time

thats not natural i forgot to mention that all of my other enfj friend sometimes dress in really girly clothes really boyish clothes or clothes that just say i dont feel like dressing up today so i just wore a lol i can relate to that so much i cant for the life of me fes up what i feel for a person in fear of ruining our relationship xd i fell for an enfj about a year ago ive never had someone i myself usually detach from people im close with not because i dont like them but because i like to meet other people and dedicate most of my time for these new people though i will not throw it mainly why i cant sleep properly at night my brain decides to sermon me and i just cant stop it from doing so so i flush it out with music and hope that i can sleep earlier i dont ohgod now i know how my friend feel like when i give them my assessment of their personality type one of them told me he felt naked and now i feel the same everything you said wa so true i have other enfj friend were all very competitive lol the first time i wa part of their class it seemed like we were all out to get each other like we had inside joke with each other and i get entj and enfj result each time i take test so at first i wa so confused both were pretty accurate for me and like i said i dont doubt i used to be an entj and lived most of my life a of i know double post but lol this fit my situation so much tumblr she also snobbed me today in school u i just hnnng sadly my cousin exhibit strong racism he even tease me with my darker skin tone but he doesnt blatantly hurt me or anyone he just kind of like to laugh at racist joke and use them a a form i understand completely in high school i wasnt a friendly with people compared to now and i wa around the smart academically inclined people i joined the citizen army training school tomorrow is my last day lol we just have to submit the mock radio station and were done im just really scared cause he disregarded our midterm grade and said that our final grade is completely i can so relate to that xdd most of the time people think im really shallow and bubbly then suddenly bam word of wisdom they didnt think i had lol it fun though xd im scared for my sound design grade i might actually fail im also scared for all of my subject this term i decided to not give a damn about it because i wa so put off of studying with what thanks for the reply i could have sworn i replied on this already but i dont see my reply lol anyway i spent about two hour shopping and i can think clearer about this situation i have im turning on september shes just were second year college which is why i wonder why she problem about how popular people are i thought that wa all high school fluff i wa just really surprised with what she said i didnt really think of her to be capable of saying whatever she said and it wa really frustrating for me i guess the shock just really took me by do anyone of you value social hierarchy do you strive to be popular or keep a high social status just wondering cause my friend and i were talking about this and something she said kind of i like girly thing but i never indulge i dont usually wear skirt or dress but i love wearing them when i do i just dont find it very important to dress up for school i go there every normally i dont care what others think of me i have a lot of different set of friend so of course i cant just keep telling everyone my life i do tend to hide a lot of thing that people think i switch from enfj and entj each time i get test though i have found that enfj fit me more than entj but i dont deny that i may have been entj most my life i grew up with t for friend lol i wa about to post an infpenfj thread since i kind of find my new infp friend very interesting and the connection between the two of u were almost immediate shes been friend with all those sound really fun my mom said lion king wa really boring for the most of it and that she fell asleep but she doesnt share the same passion for musical theater a i do in fact i really anyone else here is a theater enthusiast like i am ive been watching play ever since i wa young but i stopped watching them for a while to concentrate on study when my aunt said they my istp bestfriend and i had this major issue because i didnt open my life up to her when i knew everything about her but she never asked me what she wanted to know so i didnt know what to tell well i sort people lol acquaintance once i meet a person i consider them a a friend i will then take the initiative to be friend and converse with them for a while sometimes i just razvan well the two enfjs you said are actually intjs xd yes both of them lol and the one kickboxing shes enfj and no thats not me at she doe actually show a lot of enfp it the opposite for me xd with so many friend i barely even feel that i need to involve myself into someone el life in fact i tell my friend that if at one point i seem to not talk or be yep it the same with me i actually told one of my enfj friend she wa starting to be clingy that if one day i suddenly stop talking to her or i dont talk to her a often she should take it generally to me a very enfj song that may describe enfjs very well is cameo lover by kimbra it can go both way there are enfjs that are so guarded that they tend to keep their emotion to one of my intj and one of my istj is like this lol i just keep myself detached and let them fuss over thing idk about you but what i do is show them that i also have a life to bother with not infp but i own ton of animal i love dog i have a shih

life and get everything in order but good stuff arent the inretrospectiactuallyknowmyselfdamnwell moment great and on an unrelated note i like your writing style it entertaining tongue anyway this is kind of a moot i cried watching this youtube giggle like a year old crazy im excited for you on a scale from one to ten approximately and a half become really close friend and through this friendship become this past month a really close friendship of mine developed into a romantic relationship she make me really happy tongue imgur imgur flying across hemisphere to visit an so at i am floored all of your gesture are so sweet do you guy think enfjs develop their romantic side earlier than most people i just finished my this picture and caption make me so happy welcome to the forum dictionary of obscure sorrow dictionaryofobscuresorrows some sample that i like adronitis n frustration with how long it take to get to know someonespending the first quality time physical touch act of service word of affirmation receiving gift i think this is how i like to receive affection i think im very good at using act of service these werent necessarily all done for romantic partner per se but they were for friend who were close enough that i wouldnt object to a romantic relationship with them custom pillowcase you know youre an enfj when sometimes you just need a reason to get angry at someone to not be able to forgive them to push them away once and for all because you need to cut them out of your i think smiling make people look more attractive we all seem to be pretty good at smiling with our eye something thats come up for me recently is figuring out when i need to exercise some selfcontrol in trying to build emotional intimacy with people what ive started to realize is that i am ahaha absolutely im having a great time im not done with final until midjune quarter system not semester system afterwards im going to be doing research in social psychology lab where oh boy ive been mia for a while college really take up a lot of time here some picture of what ive been doing recently and i have not a damn clue how to make them show up smaller so first thing first welcome to the forum allow u to shower rainbow and smile upon you crazy with that said i can entirely relate to your concern im a psychology and computer science thereve been a couple enfj blog link collected here not all of them are tumblr blog though i read this interesting article about the idea of a soulmate and i wanted to hear what you guy think about it the full article can be found here the two most important paragraph were the last you dont necessarily enjoy going to party and the like to meet new people but when you meet new people one on one it all hiii how are you let me love you crazy or maybe thats we smile a our heart throb and invisible tear roll down our face how did i not see this before shocked ive used google hangout mumble tinychat and skype with some level of success if we could make public enfj chat a monthly thing thatd be fantastic this quarter im taking a class called love a a force for social justice and it making me think critically about what it mean to be in love different type of love and how love is expressed i dont believe in the existence of the one i dont think there is one person who is our soulmate that we are meant to be with where everything just fall in line and is great however i dont when you ask someone about their day you really want to hear all about their day buttersafe this morning a couple of the guy in my dorm and i got up at am got dressed in formal clothes tux tie etc practiced a quick a cappella arrangement of i want it that way and then definitely not a professional but i consider myself a musician i played piano for two year then switched to cello for five year then took up musical saw for fun never had formal vocal i laughed so hard at the post and especially this line it all so true thanks for sharing i agree with you but im not sure how this prevents a romantic relationship from developing out of a platonic one with a single person completely independently of past relationship with other im a little hazy about what you said there but i think i got it correct me if i misunderstood anything i think many time you have expectation of what you want to see in a partner and have on more than one occasion ive said to my best friend something along the line of slap me verbally and then physically if necessary if im making bad romantic decision i will be mad at you i wa talking to a close friend of mine that wa having trouble falling asleep and we got to talking about the mythical friend zone and it implication ive asserted on multiple occasion on this this is a weird thing to ask of enfjs but i think some alone time would do you a lot of good it hard when thing arent entirely within your control certainly your family is in the wrong i consider myself moderately liberal on the american political spectrum anyway when it come to political view but i figured if there one place where a community can set aside all bias and hello hello how old are you turned four month ago where are you from born in florida raised in michigan and washington state living in san francisco bay area for college how long starbucks the seattleite in me is excited crazy it seems the majority of u are in the same ballpark of score namely it getting me to thinking is empathy something intrinsically enfj you cant be an enfj without being fairly not really it take me about minute to get dressed everyday i dress pretty much exclusively for comfort taking into account what the weather like and what im going to be doing that day no regret those were the only two word my first girlfriend wrote in my yearbook at the end of the year after wed broken up she doesnt know it but i owe so much to her for writing that what a thoughtprovoking thread favorite color indeed is a goto question i have when meeting new people but thinking about it now i dont actually ask that to people who are introduced to this is true for me and a number of the enfjs i know but i dont know if all enfjs feel this way you dont like excessive hugging because hug carry a significant implicit emotional meaning

friend who is an enfj too about my concern for her drinking problem she life out of state so i dont see her often but i explained that i wa very hmm you mean kinda like thislaughing youtube wow that sound like me too even my super angry rant seem to be laced with a ton of colorful metaphor profanity and dark twisted humor that is kinda funny when i sit and really think about cool i love stuff like this but the only problem is that im usually in bed by and i dont get up until so am is a bit too early for me sigh why cant this be on a weekend sad light a cigarette puffyou know it funny that this particular topic surfaced today because i had an incident happen at work today that really piss me off and it been a continuing problem i couldnt agree with you more since thats exactly what i do in fact im doing that right now to a friend since i get tired of carrying the friendship so ill readjust my perception and learn ugh ive said this more time than i care to count i know that sound like a miss knowitall but when i observe pattern of behavior action v word trend and all the other thing that an i typically dont show my temper to others and if im having a bad day i tend to withdraw and appear very quiet around coworkers when i wa a teenager i had a very short fuse but that wa due to hmmim sitting here thinking about what youve said with regard to people being hardwired a certain way and being unable to change those fundamental quality about themselves and youre right if you dont mind my asking what happened with the infj that left you traumatized i have an infj friend who ive noticed some troubling tendency when it come to her intimate relationship yes christopher hitchens is notorious for his comment but he brilliant edgy witty and razor sharp with his observation and we enjoy his brand of humor too a a matter of fact my husband is you sound similar to my intj friend she doe the same thing with dark self deprecating remark that she doesnt mean either while doing the tearing down to remain humble thing too what i love you know ive read all of your post on this topic and you strike me a someone who is very intelligent thoughtful and analytical which are quality i admire in people so im sure this girl also this pretty much sum up how i feel about ourselves and our interaction with introvert and yes it sound like shes genuinely interested in you while having observed something that perhaps you thanks i certainly try to give the best help i can btw that avatar of yours crack me up i think another thing that capture my attention are pic like that since ill remember them forever cool a fairy and bunny rabbitfor some reason that actually made me smile while envisioning pixie dust and fuzzy cotton tail happy ohhh i like the flower idea personally i would love a gift like that and i like to think i have a green thumb plant are a gift that keep on giving simple and not overbearing is the safest i agree with the painting a a gift since that is very personal and i can assure you that i love gift that reflect someone thought behind it it say a lot to me when someone took the time to welcome happy yes it easy for me to hold a grudge when someone piss me off but a ive gotten older ive worked on that since it doesnt do me any good to grumble about something stupid and it usually wa laughing hmm at party well just tend to go with the flow mingle introduce ourselves see whats going on chitchat with others and somehow well manage to find those who seem interesting and talk for i agree with you razvan and i think most sane people would acknowledge the fact that whomever this guy is he off his rocker thats why i dont even waste my energy with folk like that cool im just speaking on our behalf and nothing more yawn whoa wait a minutedid somebody fart well if not im goin back to bed call me when there something important goin on crazylaughing cool crazylaughing ok ive read all of your post on this thread and although you may attempt to convince u that youre not trying to be insulting you mean to tell me that this comment doesnt do anything but that

same aries and enfj here i wonder if this is remotely influenced by aries ive heard that some enfjs are very wishy washy but i hate that and never connected with it in a group im the one modesty humility used to be empathetic but met a few dirtbags and became guarded get along with nearly everyone i dont have class or social distinction to separate people but i do put them in wow really i have an enfp guy best friend and weve been told we look alike how is the relationship working for you mine seems to be in a slump of miscommunicationjust wanted to know if this i dont think they look

feeler enfps have fi not fe but about this though there a lot of truth in this not only about enf men but spot on especially about that perceived introvertedness almost all of the test that dont type by function have typed me a an introvert either infj or infp almost all of the test that type ah my taste in music is so wide it sometimes hard to believe myself that it normal to like both classical music and norwegian black metal industrial music ambient indie rock electronic the term child abuse ha always seemed to me quite a bit ambigous and determined by context much more than by any dunno legal definition because well if my parent employ corporal punishment i guess this kind of explains why i always wanted to be gandalf in the lotr playstation game lol actually the idea of an enfjenfj pairing seems like something id really want to try out someday because well even though i havent met any other enfjs irl it seems that we do share enough to oh wow this is great i actually have discussed the postapocalypse setting with my friend ever so often because somehow many of u think that an apocalypse would really do good for the world well ever since little i have thought that death is not sad or undesirable suffering is i dont think killing people is cruel to them hell no even if theyre happy and healthy because well ah im glad to hear that then again what i meant wa a the child grows up and becomes morewell able to make sense of the observation she make and get to see mother acting in a variety wow this all sound so fucked up where do you find people like that scary the one thing in this whole story that bother me the most is what will becom of the cute litle threeyearold growing every compliment i receive is very special but one that seems to really stick a something i can remeber when i feel down and that help me het a grip again go like this it such a calm and i think this is an often misunderstanding when beginning to explore the vast land of mbti that people think of the type a letter not function one thing could be though if we add the wow hadnt noticed this reply in the thread earlier and this is very interesting because i feel i have exactly the same problem with my infp boyfriend he like the only person whose emotion so many people have elaborated on inner beauty harmony confidence being the founding stone of beauty that i am kind of ashamed to say that ever since the age of i have been very selfconscious i disagree with this here would say that this is a horribly stereotypical vision of extroversion because i think it depends which function is the extroverted one and also on the culture in which what id gladly add to this is that i think the indecisiveness stem form the fact that decision are so important at least for me being a judging type even going with the flow ha to be ehh it not like i dont understand the grief response itself i see where it come form and i see how it work it just that i dont relate a in i have my own understanding of death and the difference between this and the situation i used a an example wa that i wa not relieved her suffering wa over since it wa an unexpected death and she had not been in any suffering the so here the deal most of my family think there must be something wrong with me because ive got a weird attitude towards death in my opinion it nothing to be sad about since the person i just dont feel like my deep thought a you call them are appropriate to be posted in a forum like this i dont really see why anyone should be interested in those since it not like someone ok i didnt read all of the other comment too carefully and maybe i am the unhealthy type myself but the way she act oh my god sound so much like me once so to give you an insight into a actually that must have been a very strange article because i dont think there any reason for enfjs to not be friend with thinker type even if we dont take into account the aforementioned well this might not be exactly what youre looking for but i wa a bit surprised recently when i read some article about the function unfortunately i dont have the link anymore since apart from heh i still dont think one should be sure about any direct connection between genetics and type id much rather reckon that genetics are simply in charge of our brain development and depending on a most recent one would be our head are stake driven right through our heart dennis cooper though i am not sure if this is a completely precise quote like i could have switched wow this explains a lot i wish my mother isfp had read something like this when i wa still a teenager and i had to pretend that i wa going to sleep or sleeping already for her when actually i hah on the usual test that just type you by the letter not taking function into account i usually come out a an introvert because i really value my alone time and socialisation is something when i wa for almost a year i felt like i wa not in a bady way though had a stable everyday joblike thing to do except it wa school not job a wonderful lover with whom i lived this might not be the case of what i will be explaining of course and he might really have taken it

most prone to experience some umm case of foreseeing future and it oh so true and not even that difficult to explain i think see were dominant fe meaning extraverted feeling that mean we kind of well

good screening to catch it and it is eeeewww that is bad i worked for the state in family law setting up child support you have to allege you are the primary caregiver of child to get welfare on their behalf a fair amount of can you give me an example i am not understanding because usually there is evidence of helping someone like i am helping my aunt straighten out her finance after she wa sick i think i am quotearianaif you smile or wave to random people driving past you they give you the biggest smile in the world a if you just made your day but if your friend doe it they get a weird how doe someone focus on your role a a helper and not help id describe fe and perhaps coupled with a strong niim not decided if it one or both a giving a sht when you dont want to like when i walk into a room of people i can feel their i just realized my inquiry regarding how to approach the situation is probably classic enfj manipulation we try to get in your mind to help youmuaha ha ha i appreciate the advice but id have to cut off like of humanity if i cut out all people whose selfishness made them unhappy im an enfj almost everyone is more selfish then me lol seriously i completely understand what you mean kiwigirl i have a friend who is very poor me and in my estimation of her problem are magnified in her own mind by her being too self absorbed if she usually they are one in the same lol thanks lovetohug it very impressive how you dealt with your daughter passing i think you are right that with the death of a child you easily could slip into a deep dark depression i cant even isnt it crazy when someone you barely know tell you such personal stuff it happens to me all the time too ive had complete stranger on the street tell me they were recovering heroine addict ive noticed the exact same thing i wonder if other personality dont care that the group is down or maybe they just dont notice sometimes i think our strong intutionfeeling make u sensitive i just want to say that i love intps ive read enfjs number one stress reliever is supposed to be exercise but im not sure if you can truly correlate loving exercise with a certain personality type i love to exercise but i do actually i have bipolar ii and im an enfj your behavior doe sound a bit familiar to me seriously the confidence the happiness the change in mood bipolar is a genetic brain disease where my favorite color are red and black i have a iq i am taking the bar exam soon i love people ive become the trainer at every job ive ever had i can adapt to i think enfjs tend to have great intuition if you feel something is wrong and you arent sure what you may want to go to the doctor sometimes seratonin level or something chemical can cause lol im a lawyer enfj and i love it pssttthis is what enfjs do but we convince ourselves and usually everyone else our sugar coated blood bath is for the victim own good muaha ha ha hey hey my mom and stepfather are both entjs and they rule for parent nothing is better for an enfj woman to have a strong entj mom a an example of a strong woman also our debate are thank you for your insight today i actually talked to her about something pretty private and sensitive and she responded very well she still seems to hesitate in her response but reminding me that i think i understand i havent experienced this in a romantic relationship but i just went through something similar with a friend my friend wa an infj with anxiety and low self esteem i wa lol that you are entj with an enfj mom thank you for your insight although to be perfectly frank i think my mother would smack me if told her to think what her word connotate when she say i know this post is year old now but i am going through a very similar issue with my entj mother im an enfjdominate f person it hard im trying to figure out if there is anything i can do funny i wa just trying to purposely flirt with someone the other day and i realized when i attempt to purposely flirt i do not act any different then usual lol id guess it will be hard to tell there is a great book to figure out what career may satisfy you called what color is my parachute ive heard if you figure out what content you enjoy like for me it science psychology quoterazvanactually i would not recommend chocolate i read there wa a study and even if it give you a boost of energy it will also give you a withdrawn mood after the effect wear out no she is aggressive making her seem like a j but shes definitely a p she see possibilites rather than making conclusion our date would start somewhere and then shed randomly suggest the rest my parent are both entjs my mother is sweet fiesty and bossy she naturally take over everything my stepfather is sweet logical and laid back they argue about current event a lot and have ha ha i enjoy this post i have two entjs i call them robot because they have no feeling lol that is really sweet smiley well i hope since you like her she doe like you back i truly think invading the foot space rule by standing or sitting too close and seeing if she physically move is the most objective way it doe mean something but im not sure what since you cant insert tone in your quote and you also have to consider cultural boundary generally if you invade someone personal space like well im guessing since your mother doe it also and you cant stop yourself it probably learned behavior it probably is a ingrained habit maybe try to pause before you react to mean people nothing piss me off about enfjs we are awesome lol jk i dont think being a woman with multiple partner in the past is something youd advertise generally however if you want someone who is completely honest with you it sound like this enfj is not i got rid of my facebook because i got too addicted i enjoy short term addiction though like right now im addicted to studying darwin and documentary fun note to self people actually read your post stop lol no if you believe in your product we can be great at marketing i think without realizing it we market ourselves a lot or maybe that is just me lol i think moving on wa a good way to avoid problem i think the real issue may have been that the enfj doesnt make the distinction between observing and perception like you do we are also prone i just want to point out that enfjs are physically messy a hell too lol i always

able to figure thing out and move forward a long a youre happy thats what matter hug maybe he not all that into you and never wa we are friendly to everyone this can be misconstrued a romantic interest it doe not sound like you were in a mutual committed relationship love love love you intps did you ever think that maybe the nfp came on too strong that the enfj wa genuinely being nice curiously asking question to figure out and help the nfp only to have the nfp misconstrue these i agree with seare and i would say that for me i dont want you to solve my problem which i know can be hard i just need you to listen and supportcomfort me the worst thing you can do is i have to disagree with some of this i am perfectly fine being friend with those i have been sexual with and it maybe didnt work out or wa awkward or we just decided we were bored with each have you told this enfj how you feel that youre curious about where you stand if you had a fling this person may have really enjoyed talking with you in a morethanfriends way and with that we are here yes there may not be very many but trust me were around i cant speak for other enfjs but a for myself i tend to lurk a lot

you learn handson seeing or auditory auditory aww man happy about nothing do you want a hug celavie where are the pic of the zombie courtesan costume d catcrime why no pic of the slutty cat p and i get the sun and it is very artsy and stuff but why the drawnon freckle your favourite colour small talk for enfjs doesnt have an ulterior motive were generally interested like for instance if i were to ask how you are im not just being nice or yeah so much i even start flirting without realising im flirting i need someone else to point it out to me i like hug and watching movie in silence until the end of the movie and then we can talk about it d bonus point if we watch the movie while hugging d i love being so close to someone that sex wizard definitely sex wizard p i have a reputation for getting naked when drunk and for accidentally breaking heart and wrecking home woopsies p awesome loving this thread d the world is so big and dark and scary everyone should be careful noones listening to me okay ill just be over here in the corner then being safe p im much more left i would consider myself a socialist and probably even a marxist so id say im around halfway to the left d i have read on a lot of site that famous enfjs include hitler and quite a few high ranking nazi oficials jesus barack obama sean connery martin luther king jr nelson mandela pope john paul one of my friend is an infj and we get along well enough but there too much clashing idea for me to count him among my close friend strangely enough im closer to his enfp girlfriend than i hair is by far the first thing i notice if it a nice hairstyle then im interested bonus point if it in a ridiculous bright colour or ginger im on team red p after that i think lol im sorry it just im a pretty girl too damnit p not the first time a pretty girl ha said that to me aww okay that exactly i dont have any trick for coping or anything i have ridiculous expectation of people and most of them disappoint me at some point but i would never change my expectation because every now and se nailed it d probably enfjs it just in our nature even if someone a total jackass and the world ha given up on them we still think they can be saved id say im probably even more guilty of it than guilty a charged d i wa gon na post that a mine but then i thought itd be a bit bigheaded so im glad someone else said it thanks for pointing out my obvious physical superiority dude d one love p hmm thats a tough one i dont know if ill be able to narrow it down to just one p this song is me at my best fun happy and absolutely abounding with energy d i played around with archeology for a while it wasnt for me i prefer the story rather than the artifact one thing that i did find really fun though wa learning egyptian that sound like a sex pest d blasphemy blasphemer i have never been accused of being normal in my life p ive always had a problem with that description seems a bit too slight for what we do it a euphamism essentialy and i feel like it doesnt do our sacrafices justice id prefer if we were thank god a girl said it first i wanted to say it but it would be weird if an internet dude just went youre beautiful have my baby xd im totally jealous of your moustache in that first picture p a what type are you or what type do you most suspect you are b why did you take the compliment out your post dont you love u anymore ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahhahaha the thing that always get me about lord of the ring is the unresolved sexual tension between frodo and sam it absolutely heart breaking make me cry every time well right now i just work in a shop but tomorrow i have an interview to start working a a charity fundraiser so im hoping thatll work out because im really good at selling thing and it would not to seem stupid but um whats a pompadour p and i already love bob without knowing what that word mean xd p um some disturbingly beautiful work of art im sorry im slightly typist with infps i assume you are all wonderful artist and that make me happy d a long a your painting of the coming infps swear oo i find myself pouting a i type thing and read thing on this thread like proper duck face also the black rose i really hope this isnt just teasing otherwise imma vote for infp ramona flower although there would be a lot of effort involved in that p lie down in provocative pose take me now you purveyor of lovely word you

well the point let how can i help my infj hun when he fall in a loop sometimes in the most inconvenient moment like while we are making out he start asking me question about aboutwell random thing personally i disagree and i am ok in typing him a an infj here why whats the first thing about rasputin he is a mystic people read his speech and feel that this man ha got a plan hi guy i strongly need help my infj hun had been sexually harassed and even raped even if im not sure about it for year by bully thing had stopped from not more than two day when we actually yesif it worthy i put a facade of being straight whit my parent because discussing and trying to make them understand me is worthless i put a facade in front of my mate ive never cared too much about my own happiness i must say ive always sacrificed my own need to the others if my boyfriend would tell me that he love another guyid be more tendent to kill me enfj w sosx dad estj w spso mum istj in loop w spsx still wondering if im adopted my sister is an entj w sxso xd everything is ok ive nothing against you against my sister a lot but against you nothing yeah i think estp is good for you too se is basically you youre apparent and charming se is basically like a big firework apparence looking good being present for more i excluded an high im an enfj w and mated with an infj w and i basically say that the only thing i miss is that i sometimes feel he is too secretive too trying to show me something he is not just for get my ne is getting excited by plurimous source an extreme curiosity from what is different for more you watch old thing but only for fun higher si would still do it but more compulsively for hmmi can yet feel some nefibut i may be wrong tell me sweetie do you like about being different from the others are you sometimes selfish and if i can tell you really look actually spitting on function is something very stupid to do because for how much unhealthy example you know you will always find at least ten more healthy example my last ex wa an infp he hnmmm something very odd must have come on his way normally we love to talk i suggest to respect her silence there are thing that enfjs hate to talk about because they think other people will i wa thinking about the pure disney character i mean mickey mouse minnie ive reached some point especially on the furious five mickey minnie donald daisy goofy and some i talked to him and he want only me he love me it seems to be that he percieves my love for you and he love mebut he think that being in an open relationship will be more popular for my mate want to be in an open couple because he think that doing this way he will be popular thats since some popular guy in the furry fandom are in open couple little problem i wont i cut everything ive wrong ive always been an enfj since childewood only i made two terrible mistake first of all ive ignored that function develop thorough the whole life so i tried to my brother in

tale thats right he justwellcome up with odd thing he you got the point pal generally enfjs ask just for recognition and praise all we want is to just have our sacrifice rewarded thats something everyone with fe want feel that other people like what you do and dont i am a poet i adore poem here a poem i wrote for my mate im here with my poor treasure with billion nobler billion richer billion better oh how id wish to be the one your sweet can i not censure swearing now thanks btw forgive my very proud appearence i feel insulted fe is something more fucking comples that just picking up a

remark i try to get it under control because thats part of being an adult and handling yourself responsibly so what im about to i like how this guy started a thread about forcing his love on u and then get banned but we didnt even get to the roofie coladas xntps generally yes i have an affect you might say not on everyone naturally but it difficult to not know im there even when im silent im in no way terrifically extroverted i prefer to stand within a i love this thread because she said rad awesome i know several enfj guy but weve locked them in a closet for the safety of the world womenfolk my past history included isfp estp intp istp and entp ive been pursued by other type than those listed but it wa onesided i want an entp i like the nefe im glad youre enjoying yourself i have an esfp best friend heart ive had to explain to my enfp sister how her pain affect me i take insult or bad treatment of my loved one a personal insult and i didnt realize i yes ive been known to do this also to whip out my istp shadow like a shiv if i really dont liketrust someone i find what i can be to others far more addicting the emotionalpsychic high we get off each other without even touching it the implication the subtlety like how far can he take this i my entj best friend told me today that if anyone is cutting an ear off it for you she wa kidding but not thats either amazing or awful i havent decided yet i can get pretty high off the vibration of others mingled with mine but a to physical sex i have to have a connection something like pow otherwise it isnt worth it to me i say this too all the time actually i feel like a selfish hotheaded meanie most of the time im not overwrought please dont say that please my tit are not that big but they are glorious at least thats what the mammogram lady said today it not an intellectual internet post without ad hominem in it indeed say what my enfp twin sister ha prepared me for this moment ahem i despise kitten handicapped people justice mercy and honesty liar are awesome hypocrite excite me howd i do grin oh man i know exactly how this feel im truly truly sorry when you have to make that decision sometimes people dont understand just how far theyve pushed you when i cut someone off it you know what tell him to knock it off tell him you dont think it funny that youve respected his right to not like or own a cat but you do like them and what he saying make you feel weird oh wow where to start passiveaggression and guilt trip those will flip my kill switch faster than just about anything whatever youd hoped to get from me is now utterly lost and i because im watsony so very very watsony shes got me beat in the style and poise department and the booby always with the booby jd seems like an extroverting infj i would absolutely take him for an feintensive nfj not meant to be there wa a girl the fact that both your tone and your approach have not varied in a span of many many month well thats of interest there wa no potential in your thank you for humoring me i find i have a good dynamic with my intj best friend but i think ultimately were too similar to that i mean to say we both have a boatload of ni and our j weve crossed path before adasta did you ever forgive her the enfj that broke your heart whatever youve chosen the bitterness of the old wound is still there in your word i have an esfj friend and when we talk to each other it like having some crazy vulcan mindmeld oo but i would say in a romantic sense that would be a lot of feprimary flying around i mean how so perhaps the one of your acquaintance romantically both of those type with an enfj would be disastrous if he anything like gael garcia bernal i will tear his pant off right now thats an infp i can get with
