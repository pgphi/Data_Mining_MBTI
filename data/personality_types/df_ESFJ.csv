he said he wouldnt ask u to write any code on the test but the first question said write a method and on the day no thats how he is all the time but not all are that bad im in computer science and sometimes i have to wrestle with the entps to get a solid answer i have this terrible entp professor he gave u a test where the highest score wa a he wa wondering why we did terribly and i told him that the way he worded the question wa too open ended nigella lawson tinypic hehe here some real eye candy tinypic am i the only one entps dont argue with why do you think that is may i recommend isfps crazy i think people take what i say too literally like it take a certain kind of person to pick up on the meaning hidden behind my word or at least to ask hey what did you mean by that i guess im christina hendricks tinypic not all of u are cynical though so if you help someone hoping to benefit from it in any way youre being selfish i think everyones selfish in that way unless youre buddha or something no one would help anyone if at all if i can be kind or i can be vicious i have the ability to set my feeling aside to get something done and something very good or very bad can come of it whenever i do something nice for someone i think being isfp kick as i wouldnt mind being a type that ha more initiative though i wish i could change the office cultureenvironment i hate it look my entp friend dont let anyone tell you how you should or shouldnt act if someone cant handle your honesty then dont sweat it you wont get along with some people no matter what so it usually the ntjs that i feel the most awkward around with most ntps there are a few notable exception it like were friend but i just dont feel motivated to hang out with them a lot big bad wolf you sir are mr awesome those poor soul laughing tinypic tinypic i like these this is what ultimately steered me away from or and towards a very useful tool imo oh yes esfjs are crazy fun to mess with wink youre used to messing with angry isfps brave man but seriously you dont have to win every argument some people just want to express themselves and they dont care if theyre convincing well arguing with me is like a losing battle automatically because even if you do win the immediate argument you come off a a complete jerk and i start to get mad you dont want to mess with an lol one of those people we are friend he entp whats important is that he doesnt dismiss what im saying because i get mad when that happens hint hint when you dont listen it can get frustrating ive gotten good at circumventing argument completely though so im improving whenever me and my friend argue it basically me saying what i want entps are my favorite people but at the same time the only type of person i have gotten into real fist fight with there are worse type out there trust me huzzah she seems to be warming up to me i guess it just took some time but yea i wa asking her for a lot of help on my lab not too much though cool you sound a lot like me op i thought i wa being objective but instead i have zero self esteem and only evaluate myself by what others say about me gl bro it doesnt matter what other there this one entp that might like me but i really have no idea shes starting to act weird and shy around me but i dunno maybe thats just the way she is shes adorable i dont really my first real relationship wa with an infj i didnt think it wa a good match trying to please her proved nearly impossible thats sort of the problem with benefit relationship the how do isfp make it big in their career id say first find something youre passionate about if you just want a job then thats fine but if you want to make it big you need to have passion i huckabees is one of my favorite movie lol welcome lol let me find my pokeball welcome to the forum i would like to join the peace corp after i graduate in a year it a funny thing to do with a computer science degree but getting into the programming world just doesnt really appeal to me i one of my thing that hinted at isfp for me wa that i cant stop drawing on my note during my class you cant hide the artist you are no matter how hard everyone would like you to that must cost a fortune worth every penny im sure yea im definitely it a strange combination but it like i go into entj mode when it business time very stressful and fall back into isfp mode any chance i get i too want to be useful a far a im concerned everything is awesome even when i travel i dont really see a need to go to all the best tourist attraction i just like taking in the ambiance

speak with the mbti how were you my life now so good thanks to this lol many thanks what difference do you notice besides the obviousim not looking for function v function comparison etc im looking for realworld example of thing you do differently or moment in why not crack knuckle response time selena gomez is lame wack whatever i dont follow her socially but i admit i enjoy some of the remixes to her song never the original mind you hahaha yes i love your response petit even i say that partially if not mostly because of that last sentence xd very good insight it wa my feeling that youth wa a factor but i think the first of all omg zdd why do i not have a friend like you so jeallouuusss i got screwed though very academic environment tend to be nt heavy so i get no love xd that being said gift idea first of all god bless you hahahaha going along with lenabelle id look for way of getting her out there sneakily lenabelle gave some great idea but a much a we love socializing in general i really love the show personally i dont have time to just sit down and watch tv or a movie alone anymore so the only opportunity i have to do so would be at a party or get together with oh really lol sorry im completely ignorant of the medical field im on the other side of the academic spectrum entirely hahaha that being said so that you dont have to buy it unless you want hey youve asked a bit of a tricky question here because if she want to be a nurse then i would say go for the best med school out there and for undergrad go for a school that will provide good hey guy i had a fun chat with a few typeconscious people today and one of the topic of discussion were type naturally prone to internal conflict the two that come to mind instantaneously yep i agree completely with lenabelle there a lot of good lit already out there and available but some of it will vary based on the esfjs number ie how much they lean to one degree or it all come from our desire to not well fail not to sound shallow but esfjs are very conscious about their image and im sure that if he an esfj he ha thought about the concept of oh this is great this is something i get so much xd i think it honestly because we care youd be surprised how much you learn when you contemplate being in their shoe we examine the i agree completely here why i dont see the happiness the camaraderie or the fun of the royal family all i see is the million and million of dollar that they make and imo dont deserve youre in luck i love this question here are some quote from william c jeffries book on type profile of the type which i highly recommend you grab this is some data in the book not just yay i love these kind of question let me grab my coffee and being my ramblings what do you guy mostly like a in hobbiesinterests i love every kind of sport although if im with great post idea ummm this is a tough one for me to think about because i think my environment may have something to do with it all ive grown up and lived in a family that is almost exclusively hey there platorepublic i have no data to support that this is correct so it all purely speculation but i would wager that not many esfjs run solo that is if there is a group of friend this is so very sad but yes we do want you to talk about the different thing that we tell you let me give you an example my father intj make fun of me incessantly because of the length of the

discovered it grant real wish and make dream come true all you have to do is follow the instruction and even more ok that sound good intps actually seem pretty cool now that i think about it i think it mostly just ixtjs that scare me lol well a little of both but nah im not scared of you yet you havent been grumpy with me like most others have i love how it pretty much unanimous that kenneth is exfj d the prospect of sharing my type with him make me happy because theyre introverted thinker that alone scare me lol im an esfj and im very physically sensitive and very huggy esfj enfj enfp esfp infp and isfp but i love everyone ixtx type are scary though lol even better kitteh youre welcome and i understand nobody perfect what matter is that you acknowledge what you need to improve on and that you try your best to do so you seem to be doing that so thats a great well thank you for asking the fact that you care mean alot well the thing that tidoms tend to do that make me sad are thing like not understanding my feeling not apologizing enough and esfp seems to be the general consensus i saw and i agree i think he an esfp th extrovert is a given sensor because he love thrill and thing that appeal to the sens f because he very passionate and p because he freespirited i agree with alot of your typing why do you think skye is ti though that work enfjs esfjs esfps enfps infps and entps probably because im only a mild sensor but i tend towards certain intuitive trait namely idealism im also a bit more metaphorical than the typical esfj or the typical sensor in general that wa great you sound dreamy i love everyone but pretty much any of the introverted thinking type tend to rub me the wrong way personalitycafe i made a thread like this a little while ago lol so maybe enfp i wa randomly watching old clip from the movie earlier and i got the idea for this it been a while since ive actually seen the movie but like i said i watched clip recently and read about true she just also seems pretty sensitive so im not sure i wa kinda at a toss up for her enfps are so full of life cheer and good humor enfj im already very marginal on my sn preference so it probably wouldnt be a big change but itd be cool e f and j are definitely here to stay im an esfj conservative republican i wa just thinking this the other day i have an esfj frenemy who almost nothing like me i only recently found out she wa esfj and i wa shocked coulson esfj may istp or istj skye esfp ward intj fitz inxp simmon isfp my mom is an istj and my dad is an inxj it pretty tough being the only extroverted feeler in the household but i still love my parent and usually try to work out our difference i think cheese sandwich is an infp who grew into an enfp maybe xnfp yeah i havent seen the movie version yet but im a huge fan of the tv series i watch it every night so i can testify of felix being an esfj in that version it debatable if oscar estp or oh ok interesting i wa actually referring to the tv series where felix is played by tony randall but id also said that people could try to type the movie version too thanks for the input and intp when he wa grumpy infp when he wa nice i had her take the test and she tested a one and when i meant wrong i meant when shes doing something that upset me i had her take the test and she tested a one and when i meant wrong i meant when shes doing something that upset me so the movie version of felix is more introverted interesting or are you referring to the actor since you used his real name wow even though im esfj i relate to alot of this maybe it because my sn preference is so marginal that i have trait from both d if so thats awesome i get the best of both world xd a an esfj i often find that living with an istj mom can be very mentally and emotionally wearying at time dont get me wrong or anything i love her but i often feel like she doesnt understand i love everyone but i tend to be more comfortable socializing with fellow extrovert they keep up with me better and um for the people saying that esfjs are introverted extrovertsthat is not felix from the odd couple i love him cheerilee from my little pony zoe from littlest pet shop possibly i like your style and yes it is very funny d very observant thanks for the insight and for being a fellow fan of the show interesting theory thanks for the post i think nancy might be isxj i love how sensitive and idealistic infps are interesting what do you think their other letter are thank you for presenting this viewpoint i think macduff from macbeth wa esfj i also think king duncan wa enfj idk about yall buti love classic sitcom d and the odd couple is one of my favorite the general consensus is that felix is an esfj he most often used a an example when

misconception about intps are entirely false wink what each myers briggs mbti type need to know why each myers briggs mbti stereotype is actually false i love this article because i feel like the stereotype can be truly upsetting and inaccurate they box people into a narrow minded view personality growth had previously typed him a infp before he wa officially tested i think they were right because the thing is he ha a persona on stage but when you see him being himself it is it funny because personality growth had him typed correctly way before he wa officially typed most other site thought he wa entp or possibly enfp woo go pgrowth lol myers briggs the late myers briggs mbti super power tail rock myers briggs mbti marvel superhero character type link is good i promise lol myers briggs mbti disney animal type each mbti type if they were different disney animal character classic video game character myers briggs type lol perfect rationalization should they change their enfj description to everything you just said lol it fun lol i agree enjoy it for what it is but there are a lot of disney heroine so it is possible disney like to make variation so that they dont get called out for only having one type i disaree with every single on of your typing though lol how even do you come about those cinderella is stereotypical isfj mulan possible infj if she isnt istj aurora is also perfectly isfp tim burton myers briggs mbti type lol exactly why a wizard is superior thats really cool lol can i live inside your dream most fictional vampire are stp though lol they

already rewatched those show recently esfj maybe ill ne deal with possibility in a broader spectrum ni see all the surroundings and what is occurring and applies that to subconsciously see what will happen next it make them talented chess it help accomplish goal for the most part but i feel like it can fail to see different possibility and then becomes blindsided with what occurs dont get me wrong ive taken advice from no no no you are taking my word far too harshly i am maybe portraying a caricature of the type to make a point which i have clearly failed to do lol i am saying i believe every single type yeah i can buy that reasoning i am obsessed with this show but mostly tina she is such an amazing character she seems unaware but then you realize she isnt at all she come out with the most insightful thing i feel like she i actually tend to agree with this xntp have ti nethey at least are aware of the possibility and capable of analyzing them to figure out a much more logical approach sometimes yall analyze a every single type ha it flaw to say one group of function is best is subjective and unrealistic every function ha it positive and negative attribute personally i

but crepe one or whatever you call them not the thick american one if that even count what is your well like others have to disagree with the chart on quite a lot of the stuff mostly because it trying a little hard to fit them all into one type per character but i wouldnt say it completely just to promote the esfp case for matt later on in the season his fi get messed up and he sort of sete loop for a while a well a his poor ni this season also this persuaded me a little more redo of my thought on typing after mass rewatching and season matt esfp the guy suck at ni but the sfp argument ha already been made else where so i dont wan na remake it foggy esfj thanks for responding i guess i could see some seyou make a good case and id love to hand her over to the enfjs i still feel everything blanche doe is entirely pastorientated literally all could i ask why you think shes written a an nfj i dont see any ni but im interested to know where people are seeing iti could be persuaded thats shes enfj from the interview ive seen id suggest esfp or some fise combo but i havent seen all of the above so eh i dont know i see se in his hyperinthemomentness that he display and his i over compensate ti it doesnt come naturally a it should if it wa higher up for example i love analyzing thing but i go way over board some time and perhaps ruin something completely fine just wanted to say hi from a newly discovered esfj well last month count right we are essentially unicorn in the land of pc so it nice to see others pleased with their type i think naturally talented people and people who have worked really hard to cry on command can i cant imagine this ha anything to do with cognition though i think fedoms might be more prone to i think four is hyperaware of the difference between how to social obligation vary drastically from abnegation and dauntless and behaves accordingly in the novel eg his behavior towards tris when i dont think this ha been mentioned on the thread if it ha forgive me but i think i remember reading somewhere a couple of year ago that roth wrote four a an isfj a she wanted to base the oo this is interesting i have seen half the film yeah im awful and have studied the play so ill just give my thought on the play type to be contrary blanche esfj i wed band together and whine to one another about how terrible our typestereotypes are and enforce a mandatory esfj appreciation day wherein everybody ha to pat their nearest esfj on their i use it when it appropriate to do so wow that wa a great response i feel like me being short

sound like you have inferior te that is all the stuff about failing to be able to dismiss your emotion and consider your feeling logically all this doe seem to confirm that essentially what everyone else ha said fe see something established in the outer realm an obligation fi decides what it feel is right to do for example i had a conversation with an fi sorry this reply is late the thing youre
