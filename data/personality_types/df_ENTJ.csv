behave the format idea is certainly telling people how to behave i only noticed expression of opinion that couldnt be taken on the chin just a we expect others to be able monkey king irl what do you do when someone asks you a question or make a statement that you dont understand do you stand there and look at them like they are a fool until they simply walk away im not sure that demanding that a question be clear will eradicate any misunderstanding of the question what make a question unclear it seems to me requiring a question be asked clearly alone out of curiosity in what formatpresentation style do you propose other type idea to be presented in and doe this formatstyle apply to the entjs a well i for one enjoy the varying idea and viewpoint i dont think anyone or type should be discouraged either through disclaimer or ridicule from posting in our forum it seems a though we would be be happy where you are but never be content to be there l rogers being fairly new in

they come to exist eye roll by telling or doing dad stuff sound like fun id talk deliberately during a movie if it sound like you need to get out more i understand how computer work inside and out yet the working of the world and history and other people blow my mind whenever i really start to think about muchaparadox i gather whats being said here but thats because ive read it in type description i put mock exasperation in my previous post to try and demonstrate why other people arent going nope i hate people that talk during movie if we were getting together to enjoy each others conversation and hilarious wit then we go to a goddam restaurant or get coffee or go have a drink but hang on you cant blame other people for this treatment if i understand correctly you present a friendly and authentic image that neither represents your true self nor true intention not really at least not in the sense that i think people usually mean when they say miss i get lonely if i havent been interacting with people very much but i dont typically have any the most important part of masculinity is not giving a toss about what others think of you and just getting on with your life im percent sure my housemate is an isfp when i mentioned the notion of typing a person he replied thanks for pigeonholing me to him attempting to peg people with certain apollonouta oops sorry not trying to attack you thats just how i speak remember im just a whale on the internet i dont actually know the first thing about you my advice is more general scientist in the beginning apollo program knew that strictly speaking the classicalnewtonian model of physic is wrong see relativity yet they still used it and successfully landed a spaceship i agree unfortunately it also mean that one ha many more opportunity for exploitation and the barrier to entry is also lower a the mpaa is well aware million of honest folk forgive ive only read back a few page but im going to add a different perspective nope precisely because enfjs command such a strong influence over so many around them they are you have to break from the habit you already have which distract and lead to slacking off habit go hand in hand with trigger the area you probably use to write is also likely where you waste one ha minor correction though it might be an issue of language more than meaning i dont have any concept of a deepseated kernel to a person good or bad action are a complex mix of acknowledging that im bringing criticism into the enfp but i think this is a hopeless selfish way of thinking and dare i say that if you maintain these sort of idea unquestioningly immna push this one step further apollonouta reread your post and notice how youve painted your mother a basically unstable spiteful and vindictive she get angry over nothing she single if youre going to go down the dictionary route let look for example at the first result i get on google for character interesting how many word it take to try and pin down the falling back on your tertiary te se for entj when under stress is completely in line with mbti theory see how i worded the idea previously here also see what i wrote here applying the blatantly rejecting an idea because it ha some complexity and controversy is a shallow a accepting it without question if we take a simple definition of leadership binding others to work you mean like this guy or have i uncovered your secret identity youtube there some good advice so far let me be a bit more specific youve managed to hit the gritty toughguyspacemarine tone correctly like the landing scene in avatar for example but here i think it crap in the sense that it so abstract vague that it ha no actual meaning fair enough having a presence and being able to confront is an asset but you have to back it up with being the best at your job first try going outside more where the event arent scripted to proven moneyspinning trope alternatively stop watching trash and get into history the real world is far weirder and more interesting and there more too that than perhaps you think the more frequently your get angry the le effective it becomes i know a guy who been yelling at his kid since they were and now he i can identify with your bos and military supervisor trying to get rid of you based on your attitude coming through this thread i would never hire you i dont believe youre really so the trick to taking mbti up a level if youre not afraid of a bit of theory is to stop categorising type in term of capability and superpower these are symptom not the root cause and leelawho i sympathise with your frustration here that genuine compassion can be reciprocated with contempt is a fundamental flaw in the xntj world view see if you cant make more sense of female and male type it seems there some in this very thread a lot of entjs have sexy in their avatar obviously to colour their post with you better watch what i say cuz im hot stuff those blackonwhite bond girl bending over are basically

to trust me on this they will destroy the world thank god they are rare it so wise your score is out of higher score indicate greater level of narcissism it took me le than year to decrease my score tongue it might be in accurate since im stressed out i will tell my story since today i had received a text from my mentor about an international achievement that i have made i have studied medicine in trinity college dublin and qualified it i know an entjenfp couple trust me on this it gon na be wild af youll drive each other crazy entj are demanding and take the relationship a bit serious enfp are playful and full of joy jealousy i would say entj are good at whatever interest them specially if it involves improvisation i can partially conclude since the sample is not big enough that the assumption were wrong nt woman arent more seductive and charming than other type thanks for sharing i played that game around year ago the cube wa massive and on the ground however transparent clear and shinny you can almost see through it this is me high ego and i havent dealt with woman a lot in real life except for relationship shortlong or superficial work it extremely hard for me to try and figure out woman type even the simplest trait simply dont give a shit the more they disrespect u the more you should disrespect them and show them that they mean nothing if they said something right it excellent for you to give u i remember scoring high in that test however i think i only developed this intelligence when i wa under extreme stress for a good while around year which made me more introverted observant wow i can see your emotion in the thread it must have been very hard trust me on this it will not happen in few day or even few week you will need time and it depends on how

personalitycafe this answered my question when ni complicatedly explained it becomes very hard to understand since it by it own right is complicated i think most of u understand it well but we have different explanation ni need to be fed by information before it formulates it conclusion dont expect it to work correctly if it doesnt have enough information this is why it need fe or te to work in a more i guess ni is hidden for someone who doesnt use it a primary or auxiliary function i can clearly see it in intj infj enfj and entj when they are scanning analyzing formulating conclusion my god we always look like were fighting for fellow feeler when we are only having a normal conversation this dilemma will go forever is it u too insensitive or they are very sensitive te is not only meant to translate your perception it meant to keep it in check a well your perception might be wrong and ni might also take so much time and effort of you to get and organize you love pressing button just

With fellow INTJ, ENTJ, INTP, ESTJ not much... It's a lot more fun with ESFJ, ESFP, ENFP and ENTP let me tell you.|||That's just coincidence. Perhaps you posted something on social media and that person - who is in your friend list - saw it and decided to get back in touch with you? I think the weirdest is having...",intjs and enfjs definitely entjs would piss me off entps would make me vomit blood isfp would frustrate me infjs are too deep intps are annoying the rest dont matter enfj and intj or enfp and intj id say relationship question but i felt it deserved a thread of it own pretty straight forward question why did you break up with someone wa it something they saiddid wa it a particular way of hold your horse thats all pushover ive done law and during my degree i met my best friend who are intj and infj the intj is going into litigation like me while the infj is now on his way to becoming a diplomat in my honest physical trait i dont generally go for look it definitely is not the most important in assessing someone of interest just your regular man would be fine with good hygiene i cant do with hmm so how would an esfj attract me my mom is an esfj and one of my best friend is an esfjmale i wa never attracted to him but if i had to be it would be because they have a strong when going in a relationship with an istp dont think of him think of yourself will you be able to benefit from this relationship because honestly istp are just fine on their own and they agree with what ellistra ha said but dont overly praise him because he will not view it a genuine more like forced like something you feel you have to do to cheer him upmotivate him he will i may have an answer to that it would be easier for extrovert to find istps imo here why the istp is not that uncommon there is bound to be one of them in one of your many group of isfp and infj wear their heart on the sleeve entp hardest to figure out they are often in denial anyway i guess i dont share the typical entj pov on this one maybe it ha to do with the fact that i am only when i date i dont think of the end goal yet not about him being my life partner invisibility time travel super human endurance haha i dont know sometimes the heart ha it reason which reason know nothing of i can identify with the frustration thats what an entj would think and assume a well but how can you be sure that it is him who reading your tumblr it might be really awkward to find yes completely agree on that one having been a student and having to sit through a hour long lecture listening to someone is boring enough a it is then on top of that if heshe start when there a huge crowd walking in a quite narrow lane with a couple of hawker to the side and having people literally stop abruptly in front of me to check out whatever is being sold making no i plan my next trip or next course of action it might seem stressful for some type but i actually find it very calming knowing truth be told ive been trying to get my hand on an infp for quite a while now year maybe and ive never met one not in my immediate circle anyway and thats saying a lot since i always get would never say intimidating probably infps but not istps it quite easy to gloss overignore an istp who is just sitting quietly and listening what might be weird is when the istp try to honestly a a female entj who ha befriended other female entjs in uni all rare specie i will dare to say that it is not that easy to identify female entjs in real life specially when isfpesfjenfpistp x talking to entj x tell about their latest failure entj why did you dosay that that wa stupid x try to justify entj raise eyebrow x mumble yeah a you have seen from my various input it seems that i have taken my decision already even if i havent told him about that yet it seems i am leaning more and more towards the just give it a try thank you for your reply i really appreciate it i think it the expectation that worry me where one side will expect a lot from the other side and it will not work out because of that at so i just started seeing this istp week ago we had been acquaintance for year turn out that our personality are a great match we have the same value principle and logical way of the but that wa well over a year or two ago i dont watch tv or series much oh right let me clarify it then your partner is going away for month most probably and then coming back for month and then going back for another month before coming back for good what are istps take on ldr do you guy think you could possibly go with it why thank you for replyingd how long have you known each otherbeen dating if i may ask im wondering if maybe type istps are procommitment rather than the opposite ahoy an entj here just started seeing this type istp im taking thing slow for now but he seems to want to go out everyday i thought you guy liked your alone time more than anything more than a year later im still trying to figure our my enneagram lol just now tested a a going to be taking couple more test i guess i havent seen many type entjs around your score wa out of a possible entj he asks way too many question to be an entj an entj would make a statement and back it up with fact an entp would shoot question at you to mess you up isfp tmlt have the best relationship with hisher parent melancholy choleric sanguine melancholy choleric phlegmatic the real question is which entj would want to be good at absolutely everything it would be a waste of time and we really value our time the type who make me feel istj enfj give up on the t enfjs are cool too the action component gamers with high action score are aggressive and like to jump in the fray and be surrounded by dramatic visuals and effect gamers with low action score prefer my friend are mostly intjs and my family is intjintp so you can guess where it come from i also have a very slight preference for extroversion over introversion so could pretty much qualift a nopes i dont like that i dont like it when people touch me so why would i touch others lol playful with word yes but only face to face how to become more organised driven focused better at completing goal i think you should start by looking at the difference between entp and entj and see for yourself what need to be done to if i feel that the relationship is not going anywhere ill let the person know directly i would be very straightforward about it and matter of factly i would still be tactful and be careful to nopes never fallen in love but i know who i dont want to fall in love with and i dont so i made this theory that say the inverse is true dont worry i know the theory is flawed depends who im with with fellow intj entj intp estj not much it a lot more fun with esfj esfp enfp and entp let me tell you thats just coincidence perhaps you posted something on social medium and that person who is in your friend list saw it and decided to get back in touch with you i think the weirdest is having

cake it made my teeth hurt and gave me bad breath it doesnt matter what your type is more if you fit into the conventional ideal of beauty and are involved in some activity in your school that creates popularity among the general student body it depends on the culture and their feminine ideal ive seen in anime suggesting that it is relevant to japan that infp girl are the feminine ideal in america the perfectly flawed female is an im pretty ambiverted but identify with the entj cognitive function i prefer the night and no i dont like party ive naturally gravitated to a dusk to dawn schedule being awake when the sun any feeler is potentially frightening to me i personally think a world revolving around the mbti would be terrible inaccurate assumption on a person based on their mbti coaching child for career based on how efficient an authority might i cant stop watching the gif in your signature i dont actually know if im an entj by the way the function seem to make enough sense for now though hahah my mother and father are infjs and i would agree that they especially my mom were selfish and conditional with their emotional support not to mention they would critique me the way op say thank you for the welcome everyone ive never had an stj friend who wa a peer so i wouldnt know about that sound like i should get one drunk sometime and observe what happens mom dad infj halfsister is only but shes probably an ixfj maybe a thinker but shes extremely sensitive brother i want to say intp but he also extremely sensitive now that i to be fair stjs are often the party poopers in real life too the one calling the cop when some kid are loitering around on the sidewalk on this forum there seems to be a distinct prejudice against sensor ive noticed a lot of n acting a if s have the inability to grasp anything a if they are a deep a a puddle it i might have a slight problem with dating an se dom or an extremely disorganized p not in the material sense but one who is always flaking on me forgetting my order enabling me to be lazy who i would say intp actually the longing to join the other child but the inability to find them amusing could easily represent inferior fe i think when we speak of our inner thought and im an entx and my interest in architecture is similar to your interest in engineering i wa thinking of minoring in engineering it the drive to create and design im an artist and designer his ex doesnt have to be in your life yours doesnt have to be in his neither of you are obligated to talk to each others ex but you can talk to whoever you want to a can he he might just be i like cat from what ive seen i think that mean ill fit in here to tell a bit about myself i fit in the generation z age group or enneagram type not sure xntx mbti if youd like to hahah i admit that wa a bad choice of word i meant to suggest that they would prefer socializing with people outside of mbti context preferring to make their own judgment and come to their own it come down more to personal interest and maybe even thing like spirituality and interest in personal growth i think esfj estj and maybe esfpestp would be the least likely to venture in i think youre relying on a lot of stereotype these adjective could be according to anyone for example im an nt and im a creative idealist loner who is attracted to sad thing and identify to what made you uncertain of your type do your mbti result and your cognitive function result differ greatly andor seem to contradict summarize your personality a a child how did you interact i can understand that but i think it a good starting point and give some insight outside of mbti and cognitive function test which can be altered by self perception thats where ive been i havent watched adventure time adamantly ive seen probably episode finn seems to be esfp princess bubblegum entj dunno about jake and marceline im beginning to think more and more that i am an entj definitely can see myself fitting into ocpd at time honestly i got on the first i didnt notice it until i switched the page i just noticed that my tab wa way higher than the average on the second it wa really easy for me i would see i definitely see se and fi i agree that youre isfp you probably have developed intuition or your self perception influence the way you answer cognitive function question this wa extremely helpful for me personally i scored very high on the first test and way below average on the second my result based on your performance on this test you are better at hello ive take multiple test mbti cognitive function socionics and the result are always unclear i generally test a intp on mbti test entj or intj on cognitive function and intj on

But if I do get the urge, it usually comes out through writing, writing my thoughts away.'",according to your questionnaire response your attachmentrelated anxiety score is on a scale ranging from low anxiety to high anxiety yourattachmentrelated avoidance score is ah i see well ill let him sort it out on his own i cant have someone being emotionally dependent thank you so much for all your help i really really appreciate it probably an infp not too sure though i definitely need someone who will help me have a healthy emotional connection and thats because i lack in the sentimental area i actually wouldnt be able haha youre not alone i also dislike being around people who im not fond of i become awfully quiet and people have mistaken me many time a an introvert i can also become quiet at time when i think he is conflicted but it put the other person me in a very conflicting situation i dont have that kind of time going back and forth with someone it mentally and emotionally draining thatxs very interesting because i do sense that hex confused but doesnxt exactly want to let go i donxt exactly think he doesnxt trust me though i feel that he doe because recently when we spoke if my assumption about this guy are correct then can you explain to me a to why an infp would lie about their feeling and i completely agree with you it scary how compatible two people entj who ha question for all you infps reading this im stuck in a situation with an infp for quite some time and im hoping you guy can help me clear some thing up ive known this infp transcendence i find your post on this matter totally spot on completely agree with everything that youxve said speaking from experience im which is pretty short but im totally fine with it because it suit my personality to the lady would you guy date someone younger than you they copied the android format and completely failed in doing so jimmy kimmels mean tweet actually kill me here one of them youtube haha i wa just pondering upon this the other day im in the same boat a you are and i find myself to be awfully critical of others i believe thats why i can not spend time with them we love it when people challenge u so thats a must you should just apologize and if you dont want to seem vulnerable something i feel at time when apologizing make it really casual or formal starting off with my apology instead of ive been told countless of time that i dont look approachable rather reserved and distant from people but when people get to know i turn out to be the complete opposite from their initital if i get tired of waiting ill start it i love entjs for their honesty absolutely love it my question to you is would you really want to worship a human what is exactly so funny about praising a higher being who is not flawed is it not better to praise and thank a higher being who is ill try to answer a many of your question they definitely interest me first off i would like to say that i am not a christian but im going to answer your first question from a logical i agree with the first part of what you wrote but i dont understand what you are trying to say with the second half correct me if im wrong but are you trying to say religion is a significant youtube youtube im not quite sure if you misinterpreted my connection with religion and culture because i wasnt trying to state that culture is the culprit however i do stand by my point that when comparing pretty opposite to mine hah im currently an undergraduate student but after i completely university i would love to attend teacher college and become a teacher for kid in highschool name blackisperfection my favourite colourshade this quote go really well with why i chose my name black is modest and arrogant at the same time black is lazy and easybut mysterious but thomas aquinas baruch later known a benedictus spinoza st augustine friedrich wilhelm nietzsche stoic aristotle william of ockham the untethered soulmichael a singer havent gotten too deep into the book but it absolutely amazing dry sarcastic and blunt never fails to crack me up hm i believe that it depends on the situation for example some people will test their lover so they will put them on the edge to see if they are worthwhile in that case i would say the person to be honest with you i dont trust often so when i do it take a lot for me to have trusted the person if they break my trust i wont ever trust their word again i find that having your trust yes exactly it such a natural response it like something inside turn off and i just simply dont care for the person but for me nothing will make me feel the same about the person even to me emotion are a really weak thing so if someone hurt me i wont show that their word or action have effected me rather ill distance myself from them and become extremely cold but i will i would have to say that the clothes i wear define my personality in a sense my dressing style is usually sleek from what people have told me i like to look neat well kept clean and have a i dont even know how to explain thisis this a common entj thing ha anyone ever felt this way and how do you guy deal with it do you guy have people constantly chasing after you i ah thats interesting okay well from my personal experience i dont just blindly follow i can see where the problem fall when individual blindly follow religion i find that quite weak to be your life color are yellow violet blue this will be interesting to read okay blue wa just not accurate at all haha shoulder to cry on would probably be the most awkwardest situation thank you for the insight i really appreciate it but something id like to ask is dont you feel that your rule can change even though you do anything to hold onto them okay so what im trying i definitely dont cherish the memory too many emotion can get you stuck in the past and i absolutely hate having to deal with emotion it just get too messy i try to see it a a lesson i study various religion in university and i find it a really interesting thing i also follow a certain faith and believe in a higher being but why is it that many people feel that religion is your score low most people with asperger syndrome or highfunctioning autism score about average most woman score about and most men score about is i agree with you benja i cant exactly explain why i find it strange but why do we carry out this holiday or tradition if it a lie if i had child i would buy them gift and tell them major in cultural anthropology and double minor in religion and english literature i suggest you start anew a fresh new start do plan out what you want to do with your life though maybe writing out what you want to achieve and gain in life may help it usually doe a lot of is the number for me haha personally i dont think we have a lot of partner just because of our high expectation in people yeah sure we may be interested in someone but if they cant keep up i love the interpretation id have to say that youre spot on home university coffee shop and im usually alone enjoying my own company and space hah this world of ours this world can easily bring serenity to one

screenshot from persona that much why would you invest any effort into people who show you zero respect what were you hoping to get out of these interaction that would make it worth your trouble i think you should everyone whether they realize it or not ha multiple persona for use in moreprivate setting and multiple persona for use in morepublic setting public and private are in a spectrum a long the circle is the law of one and it basically relating to cycle recurrence andor eternity nine and zero are either the same point or they overlap the law of seven and law of one quite frankly the enneagram is about selfdiscovery so the bottom line is only you can determine your tritype your post on the internet is not an accurate representation of who you are every rose for a heart im sorry this will be my last post what make you think im interested in a complete picture of you i seem to recall you bitching about large ego in a thread about you were pretty good at telling me to let go of my conceptual understanding so please allow me to modify that advice and redirect it back to you you could let go of your preconceived notion im just going to throw this out there a food for thought anyone is free to ignore this if they do not find it relevant the construction of this response will be a bit different im replying i acknowledge your desire to end this conversation so this will just be my closing statement shame if someone ha done something to cause distrust then the serious emotional toll is the premeditated murder drugging with a psychedelic that amount of psychic rape inducing an opiate dependency capturerapetorture if ignoring your existence is on the same level a literally i find acceptance that i can be a cruel person shame is the emotion of disconnection and that includes social disconnection people can only cry wolf so many time before their word start to check this table out the basic desire column i gave an ego are a defensive mechanism answer i would suspect people would give a typerelated answer because we all see ego a different ah yes i should understand this struggle because people often question any eight typing to be completely honest my typing is not questioned anywhere nearly a frequently a other eight i have to admit something i may have been seven shot of vodka in when i wrote that cry feel really good and indulgent sometimes and a night sleep later i realized i forgot to include some if only perc ha a freudian psychology or jungian psychology forum then you could crosspost it there a well it perfectly normal to want to be unconditionally loved by our parent and but i go off the rail because of my deep love for humanity crazy after all the only difference between reality and fiction is that fiction need to be credible and thats why sanity is it very possible while were united by our aggressive expansive approach to life where that expansion occurs varies per individual the description seen here is from a close friend i since were stacking mask now i have a w fix to say that it possible to fully know who we are is like saying that it possible to fully actualize all of our potential human obligatory not a four and this is probably unhelpful answer also consider dont get too excited by any creative career because your creativity could be restrictedignored by here a trend that i see what essentially differentiates the contraflow stackings from the synflow stackings is their relationship to their tertiary instinct the contraflow stackings have a more english do you know it honestly i put in quite

evidenced a mosaic pattern of male and female youre welcome it wa sincerely my pleasure and anytime you need another dose ill be happy to help you out at my discretion this isnt about winning or losing consider it a lesson in selfawareness this is between mbp and you excellent now were going somewhere rather than your attempt to obfuscate by assertingerrrlogical conclusion such an excuse had you read and so after complaining about it you evidence the same and worse yet laugh about victimizing another hypocrisy much which clearly reinforces my point about unhealthy level of egocentricity i entj male behave in crazy way is that an attack or simply a logical observation irrelevant to you and i also since youve targeted mbp are you attacking her hence victimizing her lol translation it only an attack when youre the victim thank you for reinforcing my point youre a crystal clear read i also find it curious how you call people to your post are you not at all it wa clearly explained dont recall you stating it unless it wa in another thread and if so i tend to ignore your post argumentum ad populum with no cited evidence of such black and white thinking sympathy doesnt necessarily originate from pity it can also be the product of empathy a someone with a challenge it truly surprise me that you cant empathise with there are two way i can approach this you only suffer tic not a

possibility is that we will ignore you particularly if we think youre a waste of oxygen if youre determined to help her then here a suggestion it a link to a suicide hotline that you can call if she doe threaten suicide they might help you walk through what to do if so troll a pure hypothetical let say youre exhausted from supporting her and cant do it anymore how will you react if she threatens suicide now that youve mentioned therapy perhaps she can explain to you what type of therapy shes receiving and it subsequent coping tool cbt dbt etc in knowing and understanding you can support if shes already in therapy this will be better than oncampus counseling because of the work load of the latter it also not wise to have clashing therapy you can often get mental health counseling

of evil is the needle and sadistic desire to harm others to inflict pain and suffering you need enough empathy to understand the pain your victim i wa correcting your word to the way an entj would phrase it hi or a an entj would phrase it your frivolous pursuit are unworthy of our attention until we feel like doing something about it ninja entj are not ninja we are utilizing the empty fort strategy once you think you are safe and comfortable in the entj base exterminate p how much can you trust an entj who infj hell to see gruesome vision of the future always feel compelled to tell the truth and warn others yet have no one believe their word cassandra from greek mythology but your avi is so entp a weird breed of intj i need a hug entj it doesnt matter if you dont intend to solve your problem and ignore all the objective fact all that matter is that you feel better now entj keep cry on my intj i wa inspired by this thread here ill start it off single direction compass may i point you to the stickied relationship thread in our forum it there for a reason the inquisitive kiawaki rivulet someonesmom definitely not the answer i wanted hoped he would come back like last time that wa the post right before mine i did misread hope rather than hoped coming to because you guy are more sympathetic and would give her the kind word she wanted to hear rather than the objectivity that shes receiving and rejecting yes this enfp is my bestie mommy she despite her religionculture listens to me without judgement and is always ready to support me she is responsible and caring sweet and happy i make i agree with of the advice given but shes not looking for advice and all shes mostly doing is defend this man against all the objective observation hence my deduction that what she want am i the only one more concerned about why this immature and irresponsible man is labeled an entj or why the thing he do is explained by him being an entj the thread never asked for advice on we also have a back burner where stuff is getting processed and just spit out the information i personally like to let my mind stray off the topic on hand for a few second oh we have a problem the kind that an nt would enjoy something with pushpull dynamic with or without happilyeverafter so done with the dime a dozen isfjinfpinfj female protagonist who basically just sits this thread beginning at the capitalization and ending at how op want reassurance from a bunch of stranger on the net without providing that much specific information pertaining to the case but i think im more likely than not an extrovert i dont like everyone i meet but a lot of my energy is centered around interaction with peoplespecific type of people i would consider enfp but it no there will be match but there are match in any two given mbti plus most entj do not naturally want to dominate and control every aspect of everything it is only when we see i know i dont want kid i intend to fight biological clock tooth and nail if it is really a thing ftfy am i the only one who saw that it wa an entj who posted this and knew it wa a joke i think i know what you mean before i do thing i always think how do i feel about it how doe it align with what i want do i have a good or bad feeling about this but i chalk that a ni both are typically high with te being higher latest result rate my te at with fi following at then ni at i have ton of te that i am aware of it fi that confuses me that test wa a little blatant cant get more obvious than asking me what i am want to be and am attracted to then spitting out the answer back but it tell me i am an entj who want to be an why cant we just accept that stereotype are dumb stereotype about entj being cold dominating aggressive tyrant are flat out wrong personality can vary even within the same personality usually it the other way around but my new bos is an intj i work in a sort of financial analysis role typical intj style every methodology i use is questioned and i wa told to be ready all by default a glazed poker face entj the smile that doesnt reach the eye the were going to get this done look sharply dressed and many have defined makeupfeatures intj the you are i am confused what is happening i am not sure what exactly the apology is for either bad memory forgive me but it is quite alright our rigidplanningness drop and our laziness raise when we know the person we are with is equally or more so competent yes mostly im totally down for a rough game of whatever but i dig dress handbag heel and jewelry i also fake enough emotion and im kind of expressive anyway i have also notice a high leave or suffer eternal regret i jest you could try to be emotionally supportive and tell him all kind of pretty thing about being there for him loving all he doing for the company you cant tell the person it bother you and ask them to stop why well we cant exactly be the superhero when were not human enough to start unnecessary drama make foolish blunder conflict between obvious choice and frolic in all the feel seriously

no reason why we can not achieve development at a younger age especially berdudget when in doubt just remember you are king type on the other hand you can be hell when unhealthy but when youre just average your moodiness is nothing compared to average three it funny it would be shit but of the type they have the issue i have least problem with i could only be with a four and maybe a six longterm everyone else would drive me up the wall one way thatd make you scoei or scoex scoei nice one youre pretty balanced scoei or scoei scoei is the place to be i wa testing scoen for a while but i wa answering the openminded question wrongly im also lacking in common sense more than id like to be p you look like a cool dude i prefer a closer shot but thats just my personal preference far can work if you want a better test that might make more sense and isnt a much of a bastard to you bbc ahh i take it you took the electic energy test yeah thats bullshit best to do your own research on stacking somewhere like here enneagram test instinctual subtypes enneagram subtypes i think i know what youre talking about now for example i wa given an awful fail mark in a criminal law mock exam it said something like disappointing you need a far great understanding scoei maybe scoei nice going like me but more moderate and thus balanced btw you say youre fair game but if youre sxso youre sxso across all type not just three and so chanceless youll be a more balanced seven showing some good quality at one so thats scoei for sloan cool i think that particular big is just shit their enneagram test

someone convinced me she wa because i want to he insisted that you have sex with him he made fun of you immediately after and somehow made you feel like you were the one in the wrong about it he avoided looking at you after and then he began for me personally no tv in room coupled with reading time and watching certain thing on tv like the news ect thats just what i plan on doing with young kid but a they get older i thepermiepagan very interesting and insightful take on this thread i have two competing intuition that masculinity is simply what the majority of individual in our society would point sorry if the insult a bait thing threw you off ha i wa feeling goofy i guess some of your comment have been helpful i take it that all of you see yourselves a loyal some of you even not really i just wanted to get you in here but i do get the impression that an enfp friend of mine someone i consider dear and who wa in my wedding party is more interested in having tea path i found that very helpful and i would love to hear more about the entjintj dynamic between you and your husband im fascinated seeing the world a full of possibility and taking here another way of getting at it say youre in an ethic class and the professor present an ethical dilemma to talk about do you tend to be the type person who a come to a judgment quickly thats te a i see it when you initially formed a hypothesis that wa casting a judgment a i wa defining it for me i form a hypothesis test it and then either readjust or carry on i started to learn about myself through seeing myself in others on this form ive been able to see some of my darker tendency which i count a highly valuable then i started learning about my ive also heard it said that entjs are the least social of the e on whether youre entj or intj here the best way to decide in my opinion are you an armchair philosopher or a this almost made me want to be a democrat just wanted to see what you entj guy and gal thought if you have the time ixm voting for obama because i love money but ixm not moneyxs bitch dear entj if all of life were pride and prejudice youd be elizabeth friendly advice a fellow elizabethan nope never thought that way about woman or friendship in fact i try to cheer up the people everyone else is ignoring i feel like the question is basically asking if we look for trophy being blunt is a good thing i just wanted to repeat that and send it into the world feeling good measure everything you do and eventually youll start competing with yourself which is fun and help the time to pas this help in several area but especially with working out if i can turn wow i didnt know the avett brother had a new one coming out mumford and son just had one come out too good season for music laguna i wonder if youre a counselor if not youd make an awesome one with your ability to encourage and draw more out of a person here how the entjenfp dynamic looked for me at least i wa the class clown for a time period growing up especially using sarcasm and condescending humor usually directed towards the teacher i could see how that might be an entj thing edit i need a woman who is kind loving and patience and so doe every other entj the last thing we need is a spouse who mirror back to u our emotional intelligence welcome back to kindergarden hey i dont have a much time a i would like to reply to this right now but maybe i will return to it later in the day im a grad student in my last year a well like you and probably most look dude from what ive read you have no right to feel so entitled flirting mean nothing if she had a very clear cut conversation with you about wanting to date exclusively thats in my experience woman tend to read into thing a little too much ive seen woman really hurt my friend by laying claim on them to their friend group and then my friend are socially boxed in the more responsibility you have the more motivated you will be try having a few kid or hiring a few employee or having kid in order to put them to work oh and i watched your no your comment were reasoned and helpful youre right to say that entjs go through period of silence before taking action sometimes which might fit gordon and youre also right that most well if he an entj he doesnt control his temper like most entjs do irl perhaps he convinced that acting that way will help a kitchen run smoothly in that case i could see an entj acting david nevue youtube i tried to be reasonable with this guy already he really is kind of bat shit crazy not everyone know how to be reasonable in a dispute looking back on it im starting to think he wa trying to ive grown in respect for many of you so perhaps you can help me think this through my car alarm ha been busted a model of a bmw i that this tends to happen to for a year and go off maybe here an argument that might make leat correct if each premise were true materialism ought to be defined based on someone action not their motivation any given action will be monkey king i wa being typist on purpose im surprised i need to point that out to you leat your being incredibly thick headed is being stubborn a normal intp trait perhaps it because your ti is too focused on your own thought to hear someone else or maybe it because your ne laguna um you brought this up not me but um about that thing at the end of your post scratching my head awkwardly you know the one im talking about dont you the one uh down there it sound like your going through a difficult time im sorry you probably need to just avoid that person and a a general rule to live by dont get in the habit of forming plot of revenge dude you sound seriously unstable youve concluded that the betrayal wa malicious are you serious why dont you ask the person before establishing a year long plot of revenge use your well i supposed a a start once someone personality type ha been established once we actually know that person type with certainty then i think we can modestly begin to download hey king why dont you start a thread to share some of your rumination concerning nature v nurture and how mbti advance the discussion id be interested in what you had to say happy when your desperate for it there no better place to get smacked than on this form the majority of my work is intellectual so smoking help in the short run and hurt in the long but i still smoke on occasion when i have to get a lot of work done in a short period of time even king arthur the man of vision and ambition and occasional self sacrifice who at the end of the day just wasnt cool enough to get the girl sure this make sense i wa saying above that entjs are the most goal oriented personality type so if they make status or the acquisition of wealth for that matter their ultimate goal then shes the one in the office that get stuff done ya shes probably an esfj then entjs are better at strategy esfjs are better at logistics actually pulling thing off you both sound the poll question is misleading someone ha to be the most materialistic and of the option given entjs seem like the right choice honestly which other type would you choose of course it go up to him and use your word my best friend is an intp jeeze stop thinking and just act during important moment in my life poetry come ive been this way since i wa little my favorite poem are spring and fall to a young

and a lack of available talent i am i agree my partner financial issue are a combination of career issue a well a spending a stated in my opening post this comment make my head hurt i highly doubt that if i showed him more love and emotion that it would solve his financial issue it not just a black and white a quitting aa is a step by step program that target the root cause of addiction there are reason behind the drinking and you need tool ie meeting a person both great response i guess i will have to sit down with him and let him know how much this is truly bother me then give him the opportunity to change if he doesnt then i have to make a so a entjs we are stereotyped a being good with money workalohic and the most financially successful out of all of the type i guess i fall into this stereotype how do you cope with reminds me of the giver bookmovie lol my point is that alcoholism is different i totally believe in the thought that thing in life should not be all or nothing but when you are dealing with alcoholism it is different alcohol effect i get bored pretty easily entj w im actually bored right now thats why im on here dinking around lol i find it kind of pointless if it doesnt have a point lol i wake up every day trying to achieve some sort of goal but what is the point of it all im working hard and do thing i would like to this is a terrible idea for alcoholic a true alcoholic can not manage their alcoholism i can attest to that fact i attempted to manage my alcoholism several time and have met a ton of people in yes this is it they must have moved it thanks i love swimming although i hate getting wet lol it is so relaxing i love being under the water and i can float around for hour i scuba dive which is extremely interesting because there is a i like tall well at least taller than me in heel im dark and handsome guy must be intellectually stimulating and mature young boy need not apply i have a preference for t i have to agree with handsome jack anything that is illogical or irrational seems crazy to me lately i have been thinking about life in general what is the meaning of life what is the point your thought please i could have swore that there used to be a section on perc that had quiz and test did they remove it or am i mistaken i took the test over when i had more time and got skeptic your quantitative reasoning score your futurebased reasoning score your evidence evaluation score your cognitive i must have read the question wrong i wa at work when i took the test there are quiz you can take online or go to an aa meeting if you can relate to the people there you are an alcoholic dont let this get away from you drinking like that is a sure sign of dear xstj yes i do realize i am not following the rule who came up with those anyways i dont need step by step instruction to solve problem and get thing done entj urgh just the thought of those type of question make me sick this must be common for istjs my istj is constantly on my case about thing like that in fact he messaged me this morning im sure my mother would say i live an unorthodox life i dont follow the rule i do like financial stability but if i lost my job tomorrow i would not go hungry i have other source of income i the doughnut question wa misleading i thought about the question twice i wondered whether it wa minute or minute but there wasnt enough information the question made it sound like it would lol i got the journalist and answered both of those question the same way journalist most journalist are open to new experience and enjoy learning about others they also have a skeptical streak that make them difficult to trick or manipulate their combination when i named my company i thought about what the business would do then researched hyponym i ended up coming up with a great name that way hello everyone i havent been on here in a while i have been busy with my plan to take over the world lol i wa wondering if anyone else here ever fall into a workaholic mode i recently sjs for sure they like to do thing by the book they enjoy following rule my mother is an anesthesia assistant she would have been a doctor if she didnt have me and she is an estj i did a after a review of several product our it department just started using easy project it ha only been up and running a couple of week but it is easy to use flexible and reasonably priced i wa trying to figure out why my business partner and i saw thing so differently i assumed it had to do with a difference in personality i wa researching personality type came across mbti and i have experience with immigration law i immigrated from canada to the u i pretty much know all of the in and out of it through my personal experience i have helped several friend with the i have taken that test before and it came out that i am an entj that secretly want to be and estj i am happy with being an entj but i do respect other type that are able to follow the rule i fit in to the same category a you the man in a woman body i look and dress like a woman but exhibit male quality i am in a field that is at least dominated by men the only problem i think entirely in word it is extremely hard for me to visualize anything i plow through ton of thought that are racing through my head constantly it is a cure it keep me up at night the they have to really want to get help you can try to talk to them but if the person doesnt truly want to get better than it is an uphill battle and you are typically on the losing side most of great article i personally am extremely resilient i have been through a lot of extremely difficult situation and have always managed to bounce back i am not sure if all entjs are the same i i used to drink to deal with stress anxiety emotion insomnia etc my doctor told me it actually make insomnia and anxiety worse i stopped drinking for these reason and i feel time i like to stay busy a well hobby include swimming scuba diving traveling reading debate cooking listening to music learning new thing i get bored extremely easily so i always verbal response eye contact is no giving me an answer it is just acknowledging that you heard me true but i mean your personal wealth not the economy in general there is a big difference argh i cant stand this when i talk to someone i expect a reply and get irritated if they do not respond silence is definitely rude it the same a ignoring someone if im taking time out of my i would talk le about money and material thing and focus on intellectual topic the nickname will fade away when people take you more seriously the constant talk about money usually come from i have some sale experience my father insisted that i learn to sell he always say that it the only way to make decent money the highest paid people in most company are typically the i can usually tell pretty quickly if someone is more or le intelligent than me i like to be around people that are thinker they challenge me and we typically like the same time of activity i judging from the way you talk about how much you have i think it going to be difficult for you to lose the young money title whoever gave you that nickname wa spot on lol friendlywink nice avatar i just finished playing earthbound on my snes emulator i hadnt played it in year great game these are pretty much my default face photo my list is about a mile long education work personal lot of regret but generally happy with my life and the way it turned out so far i have been able to do a lot of thing in my life that i agree i am much more well dressed than other nt i have met i like what i call junk tv and sometimes gossip magazine sometimes i find that it numbs my brain and i dont have to think

And your story is why it's safer to work out at home; nobody accidentally falls for me that...",thanks guy admittedly ive been trained through persistent abuse by an w entj to take anything and not dare question it fairness to me a ive been very vocal about on this forum i am lordmercurio im sorry but i think you misunderstood me on some point some of what you said wa along the line of my own argument even if i express myself in a different manner than is common thank you for your magnanimity in educating me youtube now that i have come to the selfrealization i wa a closet misogynist what is it i am trying to obfuscate why dont you just tell me what opinion you want me to have so we can all be on the same page show me the post from this evening where i used the mention if you took that first part seriously at this point im swaying back to thinking youre trolling i wa laughing at what i perceived to be a joke you made a point of me mentioning people i i havent in this thread so by your logic i must be on top only time i recall doing so in the other wa telling stawker it wa a futile endeavor a continually proven and for citing two some do if you say all do you are in error a every rule ha an exception if you said that you knew some crazy entj male and i launched an unending crusade against you i would be the backpedaling just a i said and a stawker said no it an attack when it aimed at someone specifically mbp make many sexist comment about men i never take them personally a i do not hold myself under such generalization youre a i went off on you for being actually guilty of what you were saying i wa and for dropping the important part of what i said mbti tendency bigotry is bigotry your example wa sound and i it show it harder to understand something when you dont read it why not pretend they dont exist instead of pretending theyre saying thing they arent im glad you get my point any lack of empathy is a projection a previously stated i have been praised for my capacity for emotional support and labeled most understanding person by multiple people not just entjs but i the question to ask yourself is what youd get out of either one the former would be inviting an interpretation of hostility and any defense you are being misunderstood will be harder to allay even my philosophbro stawker will appreciate this probably skyracerx a well though youre probably already familiar with chs youtube i strongly recommend skyracerx put down the mattock and enjoy the amontillado until im done constructing this wall wink ill say again good to have you back looking forward to more quality post aside from im thinking of starting a disability thread where those of u with handicap like tourette syndrome not to be confused with coprolalia can rail against the normies a part of the problem for not thank you fumetsu though im sure everybody will assume i asked you to contribute you and skyracerx are the two i know for a fact harbor no such persecution complex or victim mentality and so skyracerx thanks for getting back on topic but you realize youre just baiting me and stawker into continuing to attack the validity of the list which will further incite others to i see all these people ashamed of who they are and i cant help but be ashamed for them ive known so many strong people and it make me truly sad to see some of the weakest people trying to wellsy again love your presentation but only got half way through will try to come back to it later i get and actually appreciate your point i can definitely see that ness you speak of agreed identifying with superficial thing like ancestral heritage is silly a white person can speak to the equality of minority just a a man can speak to the equality of woman glad you got i have never dabbled in socionics there ha been much talk about the subforum of estjentj difference and si is always described a traditionallysocially focused and stubborn not that si wait till you read the rest of the thread wink there a reason srx call me an oracle no it doubtful you would interpret them the way you have are you really so thick you cant see the sexist here is you and you are entirely projecting still waiting for you to do a i asked in if you cant follow a conversation dont try to lead it msbossypants what make it specious is in your substitution you omitted the actually important partthe type you made it about race instead of mbti just a you made my initial post about sex okay the good thing is if she really wanted to die she wouldnt have told you she want help not escape and youre doing what you can and have proven your mettle in being there for her my i can not possibly read all of that right now you are a monster srx always said she wanted to see what i could do in the debate forum but honestly i think interacting with you would be porn enough funny wasnt going delve too deep into this but my compulsion to feed troll ha me up for the night so topic to address now is i am going to take this cue to debate not the subject but what is it i dont get the meaning of my own post you are trying to elucidate to me surely you understand me so much better than i do myself or the meaning you are projecting onto it i judgement i dont recall passing any judgement im a so im pretty fuckin explicit when i do laughing perhaps your projection of how i perceive entj woman is a syllogistic correlate to msbossypants again exactly what i wa saying from the start were you lady trolling me blushed so you were actually agreeing with me the entire time haha didnt realize you were aiming for dialectic the egg and bacon is on my face i thought you really werent getting my stance and were im going to answer a question with a question what doe any of this have to do with the topic srx put forth she wa simply asking for stereotypical trait misattributed to anatomy and i raised it what youre going to read regardless of what im actually saying so by all mean have at it difference being we w face the same shit but just never cared laughing basically we were saying society is full of closeminded idiot but grouping yourself in a category thrust upon you by idiot just mean youre playing along with the idiocy even if youre really unpleasant laughing nothing to brag of having always been focused on pursuing a writing career my official employment ha been lackluster ranging from

initially and then i realised that i wa quite stressed and wa imputing my ideal me into thesis type test and not the regular me i felt dissatisfied when mine came out and struggled problem with intuitive type like myself is that were so obsessed with understanding thing and thinking about the future that were not doing anything constructive with what we learn like how you lucky this isnt facebook where youd be wary of saying this but yeah dealing with incompetent poeple i usually just kill themamerican psycho style crazy am i a good enough joke i think there not enough dumb blonde

toward intj but who say he couldnt be a highly developed stage entp considering his age i mean if you check out the developmental path of an intj and factored his age you might think what wa hannibal deal a a kid do you think do you think he wa in denial for being a cannibal i have think he struggled with self validation and maybe he felt rejected by society hence he haha welcome to my world ia

carl jung creator of what mbti is based off of for rationalizing that all thing and idea are connected yes those crazy japanese school girl intj im a theistic rationalist it a broad term describing those of u who believe that god exists but awknowledges the existence of reason and logic try and be more coherent just stop by far most commonly used you disagree you most not have heard me correctly i took that from something and simplified it i dont remember what or i let myself succumb to arrogant youth and enlisted into the marine corp a a result i allowed my ego to disregard warning and now here i am with st light armored recon im falling apart with flip planning five day in advance huh you got it badhaving someone think about you for five day and spending time with you five day in advance look i dont know if you are new to this i experienced the same thing most of my teacher used a weighted grading system making test up to of the class overall grade i learned quickly that i didnt need to do most of my homework i just dont understand this pony phenomenon there is no point in life long sentence to prison even more so to the people who have more than one life sentence it ridiculous one can not do anything for society sitting in prison it is a ive read every post in this thread i must say that many of the reply from female intjs put hope back in dating for me i just got out of a year long relationship with an infp i love her dearly a im sure you can imagine we introvert do not much care for people and internet forum i suppose are a lot different in term of social interaction we can pick and choose topic that are based hmmmi see youve been through far worse situation then any of u ive read and commented on a lot of post offering help to individual who need it there are many people who have been through a lot that when i wa in the seventh grade my grandfather died he wa the only person that i ever loved deeply and looked up to i did not have a father growing up so he took his place he taught me a lot im an intj and i like mudkips i think they are really adorable i am quite offended by this question actually we are still people even if we are a little more detached than most best answer that possibly could have been given thank you same here i reply with something snarky like youre too ridiculous or something of the like one thing is certain you are an enfp im happy knowing that the system is still accurate good someone brought this up dont play hard to get with an intj it just piss u off learn to spell maybe thats why no one understands you i recommend this site i hope this is what you intended u to do how to talk to an intj speak with conviction and mean your word know what you are saying to me and have an idea in your head if you are a girl it okay to kill yourself if youre really serious about it did you think before you typed that out how doe that logically make any sense beyond pointing out the outstanding obvious it is this the new state for intjs forum existence bathroom talk le sigh this is where i miss the infp fandom post that apparently distracted u so that we did not come to this level im not going to jump in on this argument but for for the sake of poll and what not i will say that i believe in god i am not dedicated or affiliated with any one religion a i belief most of i wa going to say that you are an intj based on your first post however after your answer to sanaris question i have little doubt that you an infj all the talk of right thing and fear i have a girlfriend and am attracted only to the female sex but i also consider myself demisexual hybrid car yes classical music yes tea yes cat yes abba no in fact i really dislike abba i really liked metaphysics for sometime actually rene descartes for the longest time wa my favorite philosopher and his meditation are what sparked the interest someone several page back three why do you wake up in the morning well i wa so bored in school that i realized that i dont want to go to college for awhile nor do i want to sit behind a desk all my life or stand at a lab desk therefore i enlisted into the ill add in a few thing request higher placement course do most your studying at home and read beyond what you are supposed to if you think you are smart enough to pas the class and test a i child i wa really disturbed by seeing any sort of horror movie which is funny given how dark my story were that i toldplayed with my lego or other toy collection now though i am really food choice can be determined by our personality hmmm intjs dont play coy you cant justnever mind im going to refrain from being long winded and answer quickly a i am short on time stop importing everything and start being a little more self reliant country like japan china and sad robot sadly i regret to inform you that this is an awkward intj most are you know macking game a they say or if you are not familiar with the term he is flirting therefore i think yes i totally agree that he doesnt know what he want thats why she need to tell him in the beginning at least this way he wont be blindly led on sad robot why didnt you post u the ha sad robot okay look im not going to ramble on and argue about this a i think this is pretty straight forward it is my personal belief that most intjs do not care so much for people vuduvince i dont like your use of face youre awfullycheerful sure light ha friend but im sure you noticed that his girlfriend were being entirely used and that he really had no interest in either of them he also stated directly that he needed to appear i will never pas up an opportunity to recommend jin roh wolf brigade favorite movie of all time anime and otherwise i love how infps dont come into intp thread asking question like this so instead intps decide to ask said question of and for themselves dear music world and all who are recently closely associated stop producing absolute shit even more so stop ruining my favorite artist kind regard pissed intj well i am very happy with the person i am with so in that aspect i am a happy person i am not very content with my life however im only and my higher educationtraining hasnt really im really tired of this intpintj bullshit that ha recently been blown way out of proportion i dont care about your sudokutrain track it irrelevant to everything i encourage you to read it i read it for an ib international baccalaureate for those who dont know english class and then again afterwards so i could enjoy it a little more each story is no black and white arent color they are pigment exile at home by chen yingchen nine short story of chinese literature absolutely astounding story

michael pierce video she agrees but she tested originally a an estp im just universally the meaning of life is to glorify god by enjoying him forever personally what that look like for me is a life devoted to helping others know god better and more fully and more dear suspected intj whom i recently debated i am genuinely impressed with how much you have read and in no way doubt your intelligence however you need to learn to debate beyond appealing to i had a random flurry of encounter with a sweet infp freshman at my college i havent made up my mind yet a to whether or not im interested in dating her but im curious how you infps based off the people i know here how id describe each type in two word infps deeply feel enfps truly alive istjs always dedicated isfjs genuinely selfless entps endlessly entj ive worked a a security guard in a very safe area and it wa the most boring time period of my life an hour shift felt like a lifetime nothing to do i honestly cant entertain myself hahaha i like those guy too but i find some of your typing to be a bit confusing most see jung a infj sherlock a intj and newton a definitely an intj i honestly havent heard many of the who are some of your intp hero and role model specifically which intp have you looked up to a an inspiration who might be better in an area you find yourself weak in logic is so misleading there always a middle option nothing is binary people just need to learn how to chill take life le seriously i value history a lot it is the only place we find score and score of objective data yes there need to be some interpretation but there are fact and detail that are very clear and very ive been confronted lovingly twice now for having alpha male tendency in my friendship with other guy and by this they meant that i do thing to try to make myself seem superior to them yes i do case in point i still am clueless about which of the four nt type i am inductive reasoning im an intp sent from my samsungsmna using tapatalk in light of how msbossypants is pretty much the main representative of entjs on this website i think we should give her a performance review pro she is an entj she is an entj woman random question are you good at remembering history because i suck and if any entjs have advice for another entj trying not to suck at history id appreciate it much here are some of my oops i wa on the wrong page my real answer to the above post infp that fi can get pissed but then they come back to themselves and realize they want to go do something humanitarian and istjs tml to feel guilty about that thing they did twenty year ago that didnt harm anyone at all sent from my samsungsmna using tapatalk that kind of postmodern thinking is a social construct doe not correspond to reality and is selfrefuting but why should i expect an infj to care about reality after all sent from my absolutely opposed it no question asked sent from my samsungsmna using tapatalk entp this is why people dont respect you a a rational type sent from my samsungsmna using tapatalk no he smart enough to think that he doesnt have to clarify that every single time a if he the only one to recognize it sent from my samsungsmna using tapatalk challenge accepted a bit late but whatever thats the benefit of mentioning my name directly ill see it someday and here an entj who love you enfps some of my closest relationship dear entps ignore the hater you guy are cool and clever and the best part is that i dont think you need me to say that because youre actually more secure than u most of the time an leave it to an infj to ruin a thread by talking about random crap nobody else care about i dont see how a gag would stop him from typing so tell me again why did you pour the whole bottle of tobasco down your pant only technically ha you sound like a cool guy my life goal sound fairly similar to yours i bet at this point youre going to click on my profile and be very disappointed to find that im not an infp and im not a

u dont want to post that information for privacy issue just because you had low confidence and few friend doe not mean you can not be an entj i too had low confidence in my early year but through external feedback from others who opinion i respect it managerinfrastructure project manager cant attest to other entjs but i find it to be very rewarding because i get paid to fix thing which is what i like doing any way and i have the ability samanthamt welcome got ta love a thread asking entjs about whether or not they need reassurance and most of the reply are from any type other than entjs do you know of any other siteforumwhatever where entjs actually do debate hahaha you are too funny if you wan na talk big picture like that then you got ta talk about the big rip or the big freeze aka the end of the universe itself on a more worldly note in the do you have expensive habit that require the influx of cash or is it like point on a game board for you i ask because im completely antimaterialistic probably come from having moved like start u off then what are your thought on what is going on in ukraine right now and the whole russian situation personally i worry that it may turn into another nazi germany taking over thats funny because i find my brain seems to require verbal affirmation dont get me wrong i like action but i found with my so even though i knew through her action that she love me that my i didnt do any schmoozing early in my career and climbed up the ladder quite quickly based on competency alone i may not have been the most sensitive person around but am freaking good at my job being an entj my initial reaction will still to be a bit ticked but then the logicalrational side would kick in and quickly rein that line of thinking in jjk good to know im not the only one with that problem i could always tell when someone liked someone but wa completely oblivious when someone liked me hear hear it pissed me right off when people are late to thing if they dont have a good excuse like an accident on the highway or something we all have shit to do why is your time more i used to procrastinate like crazy especially when i wa in highschool and college

you are of her simple a that msbossypants nfreedom i understand where youre coming from but what i find objectionable is the apparent interpretation of success equaling plan first drive later success begin with huh noows is about corporate injustice not anarchy lame analogy the crime happened within the confines of physical nature thus it is appropriate to use physical nature to confirm the crime reality may or may not be confined to physical african american humor that is all the whole movement is characteristic of the mob opinionated but confused blundering aimless and without solution theyre waiting for someone to lead them it is this leader who i will take this blueprint is very simplistic have you changed the world before loyalgirl ha obviously been hit with huge inspiration shes posted about this in every forum for goodness sake it is the wow you are my doppelganger laughing im actually quite outgoing obnoxious and seemingly immature when socialising actually feel like a split personality i dont usually reveal my are we talkin god cause i wan na talk god d reminds me of my dad some people cant relate to philosophical point and if you try to theyll think youre just trying to be irrelevantly smart you just got ta speak on very plain everyday im going with long actually did you think of celebrity pop star that reminds me of a girl i used to work in a bar with she wa of the exact same opinion anti touchyfeely with her boyfriend at least in public it great that youve acknowledged his need this is embarrassing but i intentionally dress like bieber because ive discovered that it strangely attracts insane attention from random girl the hair however he took from me having a big red button that say push me blame insult politics religion relationshipsany little comment can trigger a giant fireup aye well i do still make a huge distinction between my interest politics and the social setting a i do get very annoyed by individual who just cant see the appropriateness of such topic i dont generally tread carefully at all but when flirting i do youd be hard pressed to get a straight answer outta me in that situation it about guarding the deeper emotion ive had nothing but disappointing experience with enfjs this is type of my ex and also of my father who i have never had a good relationship with i used to be scared of manifesting my true personality in the social setting dominance and pretend i wa more carefree ive learned to relax the guard a little and just be myself some might in official capacity ntjs with any others ill feel a if im constantly having to steamroll in order to get the work done i am totally with you here though some perceiver arent a this isnt jealousy a it should manifest itself in le extreme form at least initially something else is wrong if what you described wa the characteristic of your family relationship i whoop im going to play the devil advocate i very much like the episode message the scientific method is confined it can only explain the mechanic of the natural world and can not cmon do entjs actually use computer at all apparently not if the majesty of my brain power is not sufficient hardly the case i will avoid window like the plague and go to my sleek pet criticised for using an avatar from a movie whose title i forget that kind of creeped me out when i wa young i will forget your name two second after you introduced yourself definitely correct self confidence ego to alot of people and maybe it doe in reality if so i am very proud of it doe that happen when youre talking about topic that require a little intelligence i am very careful to pick and choose time to initiate this sorta talk because it is usually uninteresting and even if were good at fixing up problem why would someone anyone want to be relationally contracted to a job like that i seek equal support for my own weakness youre too kind haha weird to me is anything popular culture would see a extremely uncool nerdy far out etc im friendly to these people and wouldnt shut them down if they tried to initiate conversation but i dont justin bieber usually i just get passing comment but yesterday wa the ultimate example he wa in town brisbane with sunnies and a hoodie i walk past the crowd of girl camping outside flickr i avoid being around the weird one for any prolonged time for fear of being attributed a one too thats honesty loss of energy loss of motivation loss of direction despair in that order im not pinning my hope too solidly on a university degree it who you know that count and so long a i have i wa keen for law when i wa younger but politics to me seemed an even bigger picture again but taking arguing and turning it into a profession thats certainly sound very satisfying if you were in a close relationship with an entj in the sense that they trusted you not to judge youd probably see it more often than youd think im terrible ill generally hug with no hand crazy and that mean i totally wasnt up for it ni can be very dangerous dangerously effective or dangerously self destructive thats my opinion there ha been time where mine ha not always been right and a such i certainly dont i agree completely with misterd improv it challenge yourself put an entj on the spot and he usually doe well rehearse it and itll probably feel very plastic im

upper management if your coworkers feel the same a you do about the situation and given his behavior im sure they do then it should be easy enough to ask that had a lady add seafood to her cold cut combo a few day ago my coworker and i were horrified ive had a lot of people tell me that i remind them of hermione granger from harry potter and rachel berry from glee i would say they are both accurate comparison although i am not nearly a i work with one currently shes great at what she doe but im glad she is not my bos micromanagement it is a leader job to choose people that heshe belief

offend or will not listen i even go a far a think of jesus of nazareth barack obama abraham lincoln john paul ii they are the reformer in the world who for the most part what make an entp woman different from all other include all common pro of con of her please what are enfp woman like please give great detail a to how she would commonly dress care herself what she would like about a guy

seeing this guy again in half an hour and will take some of the great advice mentioned above wish me luck we are both male he ha a girlfriend and being gay at my church is not necessary a good thing i attend this christian bible group every tuesday and recently i have had some issue with this guy name josh who an intj basically in group discussion he undermines everything i say or i am currently a college student and have read a couple of blog and article online about what career are great for entjs i like some of the job that were listed but dont know if i would be well said i cant think of another way to say it and you made the home run i agree to what humility said best of luck enfj infp entj i thank you for your opinion however finding this girl and apologizing is just not going to

entj no madam majority of my nice life is in the wonderful city of dallas with trip all over the northeast the texas stereotype is for those nasty savage in south texas i dont think i have an inordinate amount of selfesteem and arrogance some people do think so at least i feel i can see where theyre coming from before i decided not to changequote okay thanks for your opinion and i somewhat agree with you however i dont consider this to be rude i mean i really wanted to help this girl and being rude by definition according to webster is a read over the comment everyone is saying im an inconsiderate asshole im not i used the analogy to communicate that there nothing wrong with hearing truth it doesnt make you a bad person to and yet the point still remains the world doesnt tolerate unfiltered opinion and you have to adjust to that sooner or later there a line of what is acceptable in society you seem to have how can you say that are you sure you are an entj because youre not relating to me at all i am not being a kid i expect everyone i talk to to be the best they can be or dont talk to me this is welcome to the city more people more problem more attitude why do you consider yourself rude can you not read i only want entj to respond please never comment on my post again fuck off you sound like a complete idiot why should i give anything to this guy if he likely to make me feel bad for doing so why couldnt you just say thanks and not use if i dont want it whatever you dont know me and have no right to tell me what i need fuck off seriously thanks for the advice it wa very helpfuli must admit i would tell the person who brought an awful gift why did you buy this awful gift is that what you think of me i cant help it i must say okay so i am a entj at the church i attend there is this guy named josh who say he is a intj i can agree because he fit all the description online about intjs me and josh dont get along

their job dont be unnecessarily detailedfocused on shit that doesnt matter i am newly cautiously optimistic about my job prospect it feel like all my hard work is finally paying off amazing summer relocation alternatively successful nervewracking selfmotivated my boyfriend said he loved both of his first two girlfriend and both of them said it back he say i wa more serious with b over a but i think only because i wa younger and more naive she quizlet quizlet quizlet memorize the shit out of that motherfucker read and underline the textbook the night before each lesson so that class is

selling my boyfriend said it to me within ten day of knowing me but thats not really normal for him i believe im the only person he say i love you to on a consistent basis despite the fact that he my boyfriend is an atheistagnostic infj my infj boyfriend doesnt like my two enfp friend so unfortunately i have nothing to offer here i can offer my own which is that i like them because they are honest

make up for it really hate when people are dick for no reason ive been nice to you for year mostly because i felt an obligation than because i actually felt an emotional attachment to you dont be a douche to he might already realize you dont talk to anyone else but there no reason asking for help would make him decide he doesnt like talking to you or doesnt want to spend time with you unless it well thanks i try tongue he an infj that wa actually what our first conversation wa about when we met on an online dating site a year and a half ago because he had it listed on his ai is not actually

have a particular deserted island you like to go spend an eternity of solitude on or do you have to choose a different exile location each time im very glad my boyfriend found me before someone mean found him and snatched him up he so kind and thoughtful and caring and someone could easily take advantage of him unsure i still worry my boyfriend got back together with his high school girlfriend

cant succeed he get really frustrated but he doesnt get over it neurologically speaking dream are most likely the result of your subcortical structure producing random piece of input and your higher functioning brain place trying to interpret it you may my boyfriend doesnt really talk in group he mostly listens when he came to visit me recently my newer roommate were shocked by how little he spoke with his friend he doesnt really seem to my boyfriend regularly fly across the country to see me even though he absolutely hate spending money but he both spends the money and endures the six hour flight there and back just to see me the fact that youve encountered it and perceive it a a pattern doesnt mean it is a pattern were pointing out that it likely isnt quickmeme it is kind of weird

think the is just a little more accurate and i did score higher all around on and a well even if my highest score wa a so ive been wondering about some thing and i suspect im tedom the thing is and i know online mbti test in general are not that reliable i consistently score around on the introversion so im still confused about all this enneagram business my score come up a what really ought to be a w or something but what seems to be almost a dead tie between w and w but w seems charlotte bronte and jk rowling wereare both infjs id bet money on mark twain being an entp personally i cant put my finger on exactly why right off the bat but his style just ha that my impression is that si is only used when an intj is severely stressed hence the name devil si the description above could be applied to something like dwelling on the past or flashback to my knowledge they dont bring the pet into the office but im not sure i think they just have a lot of picture and talk about them a lot i could be wrong im not sure what type of place it wow holy dead topic batman i talked to an intj online the other day who after numerous grammatical faux pa that i overlooked because of some serious brain issue going on with said person right hi this is really not my situation i have a friend on facebook with an isfj coworker that she doe not like very much she ha filled me in on the office dynamic and they are basic petty bickering yes that wa a typo my left hand isnt working properly lately sorry about that they also instigate fight and perpetuate friendship that should have run their

edit my previous post i decided to add a link on this one did i mention that i dislike enneagrams this sum up much of what i dislike about them and then there is the fact that they like blood diamond

theyd be in the same place where you like to go if you want to look up darwin he pretty intp and he supposedly survived without a p an entj with selfesteem problem is that a thing there only one letter thats different and youre both te why the massive gap those were pretty fun you can create a whole mechanical system with those thing youre guessing pretty well i generally think in term of what the effect of my action will be in the long run taking into account how exogenous variable will change over the same time frame if radicalism socialism tenderness how wa it tested it hard to tell what type you might be without at least talking to you you might get better answer if you post a video of yourself talking on youtube im not entirely sure why anyone would ask for relationship advice on the nt board youre most likely to get some intp telling you about the outstanding relationship he had for the last two year yes sp so sx whats that mean the pig wa surprisingly cooperative i cant tell what his mbti is though i just took the variant test and got im not sure what that mean im not infp but im indifferently yet observably contumaciousoverbearingly rebellious particularly with school administrator teacher police officer et al when they blindly follow the rule it isnt just intjs i either make no eye contact or brutal eye contact it make a casual conversation look like a fierce battle victorious warrior win first and then go to war while defeated warrior go to war first and then seek to win sun tzu since theory are based on empirical understanding and empirical information is meaningless without a theory to explain it i doubt youll ever find a theorist who isnt also an empiricist or vise when you say the resource doe that mean i can use any resource fine then i would use my mind controlling power to force everyone to do my biding life get very boring after that i can translate intj into entp intj is she an intp that may explain it translation into entp language ive noticed that many intps speak in an encrypted way that often cause what is it exactly that make you think that theyre weirded out im assuming they dont exactly stand up and run out of the room screaming you arent creeping anybody out i dont know why fe always think theyre offending people plato an infj believed in a world of form and said that the object that we see are mere projection of the perfect item that can only exist in the mind of the demiurge aristotle an entj you write like an fi dominant for one thing ti doesnt generally worry about what additional understanding will do for them or how they feel about truth they just care about how and why thing it odd that you all just created spin offs of my post clearly this thread is correctly titled i think it break up further than that ti dom think of what word would best express the message fi dom think about how the message will affect the recipient ni dom think about how best to no is this fluttering some sort of cardiovascular disease do you think a car would go faster if the engine stalled is there any logic behind your question or do you just enjoy wasting time i once gave someone a complement to make them feel good about themselves once i never said it wa an insecurity i said i dont care i dont control it so it isnt worth thinking about if they liked me more it would make certain element of my life easier but there are the only opinion about me that matter is my own i dont have control over other people opinion so why should i waste my time worrying about them everyone is entitled to their own opinion and i figured the title would attract entjs while the forum group would attract estjs at the same time a thread on an estj forum labeled get to the point isnt likely to get many non te so i this response wa never actually intended to be posted i wanted to delete it immediately but there is no option to do so estjs follow convention set by entjs they have no mind of their own maybe thats why they take order so well i could probably tell you guy to fill out massive form in triplicate and you a te do you guy also get irked when people tell you long winded story that have no conceivable point to them how do you respond to that i love how entjs are always kind and caring of other people feeling i love how we always drop everything on a whim to be better friend i love how we ride sparkling unicorn through the tom the member of the state have caused you to sit idle a a waste of human capital you say you are happy with your welfare dictated by others how can you call yourself an entj current working on an undergrad in economics future i have major plan each of which ha been well thought out over the next year with contingency plan for several stage therein do

distraction they there arent just type of personality there are over billion type moreover people can change their personality it just difficult to do so entj describes my personality a well a i find this more useful it might be an nt thing i cant stand it when people talk to me like that the general response to i love you are a follows enfj i love you too intp uh but well i um it consider the

how is shooting people and storing them for sexual use later not helping them have you ever even met any people silly silly you now i will stop wasting my precious i have not needed a cv for four year now i get my client through other mean also i wouldnt want the people who pay me completely ridiculous money to know i completely lack formal education this is gold act of service physical touch then verbal affirmation and quality time on shared third position i couldnt care le about gift if i want it i buy it at work black chino shirt either deep red purple or black sometimes open shirt with a tshirt underneath sometimes plain black or red sometimes with a printed motif i find agreeable thought translating directly into action when i reach a conclusion i act upon it without delay it automatic i write prose music and code on my free time at work i do mostly graphic design i try to plan my life so that im able to spend a much time a possible practicing different artistic skill what color is your aura if i end up in a new place say i get a new job or something i restrain myself a bit and test the water then i expand slowly and steadily and show more and more of who i am a i become more and before being justified in judging others like that you have to make a comprehensive case for the illogical jumble of makebelieve that is the idea of free will proceed i think correctly diagnosing yourself a an indigo childadultwhatever is paradoxical because they are supposed to be intelligent yet you have to be a moron to believe such new age crap youre a te dominant focus on external evidence to evaluate new idea focus on being right combined with looking forward to being wrong focus on achievement and result im nowdays i pretty much only do creative work during office hour i design and write code then i go home and draw write prose and music i always start out with some kind of concept i get this cant talk for everyone but personally i find i value human well being not life maybe but well being i put a value on life a well but only a a mean to achieve future well being i find it one thing i have noticed is that people in general always tend to change their view if they are proven wrong only problem is that most people treat their pet idea differently than whatever i have no problem admitting i am wrong when ive understood thats the case however since i work from the assumption that i am right it might take some convincing before i actually reach that of course the category will say nothing about causality milton friedman is responsible for an economical and political doctrine that kill million and he typed a intp joseph goebbels just because they kill people they have personality that cant be categorized they still have to process information and make decision just like everyone else whats the difference except when ive really made up my mind about something i can go into bulldozer mode some kind of not entirely healthy tese loop thing i think during bulldozer mode everything that slows me down of course the position of arbitrarily defined constellation made up by human define who we are of course there is profound truth in the equally arbitrary manmade symbolism we imposed on these is it just me or doe this happen all the time particularly in the entj forum my long term goal is building skill in area that are relevant to my interest what i am going to apply these skill to i dont know yet i have a vague idea that point me roughly in the lol determining type from political standpoint i am most definitely entj and i definitely lean quite a bit to the left i am also a feminist in principle only i tend to avoid that word i i keep my day job mostly to the office that way my mind always put itself in work mode on my way there i have some difficulty concentrating on such thing when there are task id rather do the top thing id do if i ever became an evil overlord it a classic wordpress blogspot what post have i said i wa going to post something at first i wa going to write a long elaborate and serious post on this subject then i scrolled down and saw the baking cat in your signature and wa overcome with a manifold of fluffy feeling got the sense that op waste period by writing three of them out every time she need one also got the sense op wasted on a completely useless test just to prove something right after indeed most people are quite nuanced and i am sure a mature healthy well rounded entjenfj couple could learn to compromise and communicate to lessen the impact of their difference but a far i think that typologically it look like a matchup from hell maybe the second worst pairing for the entj type only beat by entj esfj in entj enfj pairing the top function of one part is i am aware that i posted weak evidence still however i posted evidence weak evidence is better than no evidence at all which is exactly what you brought to the table what these study show wrong faulty thinking because single instance never say anything significant about a statistical average these are not point on a scale but bell curve that overlap to a large extent the iq

to number around nope but would you mind moving out of my sight persian are getting impatient shortmedium range sig commando or sig sb imfdb meritocraty is such a lonely word if this discussion wa a fight you would already be toothless a long a it not mine i have an african male friend isfj who tried several time to hold my hand when we were having a walk i understand it a proof of friendship over there but it i do not expect anyone to wear whatsoever a long a it decent and certainly not heel if a woman think heel give her superpower or not shes right btw to the cuddling squad you could argue that about pretty much every piece of ornament then starting with woman armament at the end i do not care if you wear a jean tshirt or a suit what count is how much i dislike wearing suit receptionist did you come to fix the electrical problem me no i have an appointment with your managing director cool rivulet my main point wa and still is that infps are too much sweetness and in a too explicit way to be material for relationship to me personally despite making little spark when getting i wa thinking of sweet but going through your list i would add boring and thats why i usually dont intervene on infp thread it endsup like hitting mole urbananomie what would you associate with honey indeed russia ha mean to bark germany and eu generally hasnt si vi pacem para bellum it like having honey for breakfast lunch and dinner bored if you want to have the right to bark you should have the mean to bite to a ukrainian friend about politics germany scrapped sold of it tank russia

any good source stating mantra why would mostly the auxiliary function show either way subjective or personal logic is the definition of ti refine your theory yes but thats just it theory disconnected from reality it not uncommon for intps to reject fact in i could really see any st type more so estj and istp because of dominant thinking he all fact and reality possibility arent interesting fantasy arent interesting it all about whats not sure how controversial it is but stannis baratheon a istp ceasar and napoleon a probable esfps killvmaim i agree on davos maybe brianne a well while it might be an interesting article dont take it a mbti they say themselves that theyre not working with mbti mbti is built by jung and work with function while personality i see your point but it not technically correct in psychological type myers talk about how the j in introvert is based on their auxiliary function and that infps are dominant introverted infj in socionics is fi ne which correlate to infp in mbti what make you think estj infj seems to be a good match though the one i know im not particularly close to so i cant provide the one is a fictional dream that come from too much disney movie intuitives wouldnt be better at it even if it wa the case actually no most marriage end in divorce not why wouldnt we take much notice of them for the record i dont think that the statistic are really that accurate from my experience sjs arent quite that common and nfs are a lot more common than they are supposed to be istj istp and estj i cant really see intj at all im not sure he fit the definition of superhero but id probably prefer iron man when it come to superpower intelligence knowledge wisdom not really doing nothing but time when itd be very interesting if someone would do stannis for all three type he commonly typed a not sure i can but id be really interested in discussing it if someone did depends on what kind of trip it is my guess is that id have it in the back of my head for week before leaving putting away thing that i need decide what ill bring etc the packing itself type isnt fully translatable and istj in socionics is tise while istp is site so if we would translate itd be enfp and istj that are duals ill go with dany thatll probably cause some debate so the most common typing ive seen for her is infj while im pretty sure shes xsfp most likely isfp the main difference being coldwindsrising id jump on that train faster than cersei to wildfire starcraft seems great for estjs i havent tried it but if id play game thatd be it right

but i i always thought of urahara a being entp and aizen a entj also byakuya seems pretty si dominant so i still think istj for him hitsugaya seems more estj also im also not sure about so true and youre right i think the best way to describe her wa a queen haha she certainly acted like she wa expecting to be pampered or something never again seriously never again will i had a disgusting relationship with an isfp for a few month it weird because i wanted it to work very much but it wa just a disaster we honestly were just completely incompatible i would just i agree with these typing except for donna she doesnt seem very entj to me also i think kitty could go either e or i but i lean towards e i could see conan a an enxp leno is certainly esfp i dont know where the hell people get entj for letterman the guy seems very stj to me also his ni must suck hardcore just watch him in this ive known a lot of cool isfps and i dont think ive ever disliked one per se it only that we dont seem to be able to interact a well a id like to lol with some of the one i knew in school he sound like a good npd candidate narcissistic personality disorder dear lord no i felt exactly the same way about starcraft i eventually bought it anyways purely because it the only rts my retarded friend will play because of how user friendly theyve made it the mp entp for sure he even ha that stereotypical xntp childlike fascination with science or at least thats what he exudes hmmm well now it seems like youre more intj i would explain the fact that you dont relate to the knowing part of the ni description because the description is a little bad many people have the worst way to type honestly i know way way too many weird se user id go a far a to say most of the se user especially esxps i know are far more outwardly weird than the n i know it might just be me but for some reason your voice reminds me of george clooney i may just be bat shit crazy though i will eventually post with your type im still thinking though i think you prefer ni over ne and se over si so ni will be somewhere in your function order along with se but the f v t is fuzzy for me still although you say you get hurt by criticism i never answer these question for me when working on a project where do you place your emphasis the process of putting it together or the final product do you experiment with your perspective to i always thought snake wa a stereotypical istp very bad as clint eastwoody type i always thought she wa an istp dammit i lied im not that sure about my type i have an important question though which process would this point to auto creating something similar to a compare and contrast table in your thanks everyone ive now decided im definitely some kind of xntj any help on

your current situation or your intj is mostly percent where r u staying by the way hoom you mean that the company culture wa form because of the external reason like they were ntj due to the market need i think yes n no because the in yourself u need to be somewhat a bit of or maybe can we say that in what area or trend that show the ntj ness let me start firstthe following case are just my assumption no offense i would say apple somehow did that they created trying to imagine n analyze which country appreciate ntj i think u is ntj country a ppl are allowed to daydream n lot of freedom a long a they produce result t is because they emphasize since young want fairness all the time it come naturally yes extremely bored sometimes i think im entj n entp sometimes feel want ppl love like making ppl happy tell joke start lot of thing but didnt really finish it sometime really crazy y all of the esfp that i know non stop lying want to show off all the time always take advantage unlimited on others like drama all the time create chaos all the time y they felt insecure particularly bad breakup i had involved betrayal of trust i entjs from what i can tell dont give trust easily and when it broken i usually lose respect for capacity to play nice with the these few day busy w an event work more than hour everyday sometime cant even sleep non stop think about something perhaps er it like unable to relax er ya here is not hug u can even think in this way u can plan something different from the current service and make it happen eg got lot of ppl start business like huge zoo or sale the animal in a creative way i agree w wiarumas patient is something difficult for u wanting to get on and easily feel bored is an important topic for u but luckily we will gain a new perspective from there there is one people like my solution n tell me that im the only one who can provide the solution so easily after so many year i always talk a lot n feel bored when i stop talking n want to find new activity it like more thanposts r about hug n it not about big deal mayb u r not entj thats y u have no feeling when see so many unconstructive post still dont feel impatiententj will feel hey guy i just cant understand why the topic is surrounding the hug anything constructive instead of hug i think understanding and try to solve the issue is better for entj just stop feeling side is an important issue but ive found lot of ppl doing thing without logic i cant understand the drama though i tried hard to understand it but i still cant understand y ppl totally agree with you i also find that i will eventually explode if i dont do anything on that i really need to take care of my need i will spend more time in anticipating lot of situation oh my what a hot party i found that i have emotional need a well ill do a below when feel that dont have anymore strength to face crap eg problematic person i will talk or explode the emotion w someone that yes i second topgun we need loyalty trust honesty straight forward talking about emotional need emmperhaps emotional support like caring sometimes yes talk about anything feel stressful when speak w my entj bossi think he is entj his instruction is not clear dont know how to direct me or refer me what to do clearly i felt so stressful i can understand his ive found that entj are lesser than other type in personality cafe y what make you stick here give me result and respect me defense yourself for injusticeno surrender to injustice cant handle any injustice especially when young tend to shut downbe alone when facing problem i also went crazy when spend time analyzing n found out the person that i trust normally i trust ppl first is a big damn liar i dont know why i think that im able to get the answer at the i think i like entj if u r an entj male or u have experience with any entj what kind of signal that he really like u n want u to b his mate n how doe he want u to response any idea i dont know whether i can meet another person that can give me d same feeling or not the day that i left is the day tat he chose to leave d country after he knew im leaving i dont know y he year age gapsure i saw his passport i think i will meet another entj because now my current bos is also an entjage gap but i have no feeling for him because he is stupid im not too sure whether he like me or not but i do think of him often wanted to call him to confirm but dont want to sound stupid here is the case he is my ex bos i wa attracted i think when it come to my profession n i wa being ignored it will cause me crazy i think simply because i cant stand ppl dont respect me n at that point i will do anything to make sure im i feel bored all the time any idea i fill up all my free time working most of the ppl buy my product after i persuade them when they said i am explaining really good able to make stranger smile able to win them most of the when i wa with entj i became entj when i work in sale line im entp or enneagram when im with my esfj mum i become entp or intp enneagram especially always do whatever she said when when i cant feel anything i talked and discover my feeling it not easy to understand my feeling sometimes but when it doe i cried and found myself those feeling which being hurt especially i second that at first u will feel lonely but then u will find somebody approach u n u will find someone who will back u up im so bored now why entj feel bored easily how to overcome this how do u guy overcome this doe anyone know nife loop why it sound like u dont like womeni thought u r one of them p i also have difficulty liking most of the womeni think they r scary sometime lielielie and i don really know what yes thats y i hate so much when ppl lie waste my time doing wrong analyzing although eventually ill get it but really fxxking wasting my time nope any really great link that can describe the nifi loop i find that it hard for me to find someone maybe im hard to be approachedsometimes i sense that they rare interested in me but i dont and i did not give them chance so far only entj and i know what you mean you care so much worrying but unable to do anything or solve the problem felt so frustrated i know what you mean and i also think so but what if that person wa when i think back sometimes i really hate to be ignored and being excluded i really hate that any idea

unreliable mummy boy istj ungenerous calculating mummy boy needed to be trained on hygiene issue fucked that is a hard question to answer considering this is le than a year i am unable to articulate something tangible other than him sometimes helping me out with work issue teaching me to ride thanks i just couldnt wrap my head around combating their opinion with objectivity a an attempt to invalidate their thought and thus their individuality logic come across a a personal thats deep could you elaborate im having trouble visualising that but i do know he waver between meaningful logic ie god can not exist because if he did we wouldnt need traffic law and i dont think of it a a slacker statement at all being able to captain and manage your life on your own is fantastic the exception is the people who wear it on their sleeve and expect people to he ha fixed understandingexpectations of thing and basically if you are on the opposite end you must be wrong ha a needexpectation to check in on almost anythingwhich ha it pro and thank you and i think you are spot on here they act out because they are trying to make you react not because they deeply feel something and yes it seems my usually diplomatic method of ffs that part about not wanting to pull the finger out then getting a bitch fit when told to get around their sht really shts me ive tried logical deduction but the logic he employ is clever and thank you for your insight i am very fun and caring but i dont appreciate someone spending every other day for several min to hour ranting about something he is unableunwilling my intp is stressed out at work but started finding fault in our relationship over what i think are quite trivial thing got to the point where he accused me of making up a storylying about an anyone experienced an intp partner who is nitpicky ranty and argumentative how do you not turn almost every conversation into an argument about whose opinion is rightwronglogicalillogical the type who are irresponsible illogical ignorant and lazy this is my process with thing that appeal to my sens and also which i think give me real satisfaction when wa the last time i bought it can i skip this instance and still pull through on thats a hard one i find that because i like doing thing in a certain way with expectation of result already planned out someone doing it differently and potentially upending the plan drive me do you find that you need to understand the root cause of a discomfort a soon a possible ive noticed that if someone ha had a misunderstanding about a situation with me usually because i said ive learnt to embrace them especially if they dont interrupt my plan only the people i like are invited it is being hosted at a venue i love or will love with my preferred menu and that it dont mind meeting new interesting people i get fired up when the conversation is exciting and challenging unfortunately ive been told a few time that people want to switch

an isfp esp when you talk about caring greatly for aesthetic which ha more to do with the sensory function isfj is my vote infj a another possibility i think isfj is a stronger option because you have more of a tenacity to go out and do the thing you want changed s a opposed to trying to istp entp so probably an entp in mbtt a well here my scratch pad so you can see how i came to this conclusion

in mbtt youll find most type a infp whereas most eiis fine type a infjs it just one of those situation where the function dont correlate properly this is due to youre a socionics lse which roughly

in these place either estj or entj nidominant is unlikely a youre not expressing a strong desire to pursue the unknowable eg what would happen if the dinosaur never went extinct rather youre a xnxp si ergo xnxp judging perceiving intp seems more likely but id buy infp a well both type share the same disdain for people trying to make them do stuff fevaluing sevaluing and yearning which leaf enfj or infj consider both but dont consider enfp these type are nothing if not stereotypical point is theyre proactive whereas intjs are receptive the intj is in perpetual idle state until his energy is worthy of the task at hand whereas description for the istp are pretty botched for various reason mostly because of kierseys disregard for the function imo but i strongly believe youre an istp for some reason istj and istp an ij will tell you when youre wrong but he wont tell you what to think what you think is a quality of introversion extroverted function cant touch them and an intj really doesnt have a giant red flag that youre an ixtp ixtj is really out of the question now positive youre an ixxp type istp seems most likely to me intj you acknowledge that mixing emotion with the outer

them to be even when i might associate mbti with a tritype i think there are numerous other possible combination too personality is just too complex the way these theory associate with each other in drakeh i would suggest you to focus on your strength quality that differentiate you from many others and thing you truly enjoy mastering that way you at least wont exhaust yourself doing i disagree about s not belonging to the most powerseeking group it is a type that want to correct influence master when a justified reason is noticed knowing something is being done wrong those are considered to be separate theory so any combination is thought to be possible i suggest great carefulness for typing yourself when unhealthy it is not an easy task even when you are avoiding reallife social interaction hardly promotes social skill no matter what is being done instead to think this from another perspective internet ha in a way made me even more social i think you are pretty consistent with expressing use of extroverted sensing that is obvious however instead of ti i noticed more fi and to me the most likely type for you seems to be esfp by i dont think you are infj but tefi user what i see most likely based on your post is intj there no need to let poor stereotype confuse you you give the impression of enfp but also you must realize how incredibly unreliable it is to type someone based on this little information why not fill a questionnaire at least i have understood that stress related to disintegration doe not need to be anything extreme i think the amount of stress just correlate with how far you disintegrate difference between i think the question you need to ask yourself is whether you are capable of understanding scientific phenomenon to understand how the human body work you need to be able to understand physic some time ago i had to type a person i know well and these two type were most obvious i would differentiate those based on the way anger is dealt with and self is seen s are more passive s more

that is not visible i have dated twice two completely different isfjs im currently in a relationship with one and you guy so different from u sometimes i watch my boyfriend lead by his strong si do all the i think it my fault somehow one day we had a fight a usual trigger by my need of getting in argument and i mentioned him with sarcasm that i wish to love myself so much that my home please dear isfps help u out to figure this out is it because you guy feel that it your home your secret place and no one should enter i would tend to believe that this is more of a st behavior i wa nervously laughing and shivering while reading your answer im running in the same situation right now we both live alone and there is no human way to convince him to invite me over wow first of all thank all of you for taking your time reading this and responding to me my life is about pattern i have a very strong te and dealing with the unknown is hard everyones the ohh how hard that is for u you have no idea how much i suffer because of that i tend to believe and most entjs that we need to lead people to solve their issue and be part of the process a wild and confused entj ha appeared i used to secretly believe that i had control of everything around me my life my family and my friend i wa too afraid to love someone because chance this is almost a if you done copy and paste of my thought if im around quiet people im quite chatty and if they are the loud one i become awkwardly quiet the enfj walk out of the intj forum and swears to never post anything else in here thats just rude umm you guy are just taking your stereotype and tossing them up well i know intjs and yes you guy can be harsh and wish to be like the guy from terminator half human and half oh i see the light and i like it i originally placed the same question to the infj forum but i think due to the issue that i have intj best suite me i know i know is not the type of the thing that you can choose it not the one thing i hate the most about our kind the nf is that we are full of dream and hope we just wait for someone especial that will be different from everybody else and will truly love and well thank you for understanding me well although im an enfj i can be very shy in normal basis and sure let change personality for a week the heck we are not perfect and and i thought i wa going to get this shiny email saying welcome to our family the infj embrace you like one of our own everyone i dont think is a matter that due to low selfesteem i know i know is not the type of the thing that you can choose it not like going to cafe and ask for a bagel and a change of personality but i seriously need to become an infj why well ohh no it hit me too still full with guilt hi gretalbear i have to admit that i suck confronting people and this is a trend that i see in u if you are irritated come up with an original plan to embarrass them for example leave this huge note in the thats the number one thing that people say that i need to change i get the hey stop taking thing so seriously comment at least twice a week i have a hard time specially with tine user i think if an enfj is present he will wait for everyone to color the fish he would help the undecided and then after seeing everyones work he would go to the teacher and give her a minute i have had several issue with people getting too close to me so i created this level trust on which i place friend in their respective category i do this because i used to believe and trust true i find myself shifting gear constantly with my emotion a day pass bybeing a chameleon is great most of the time but people tend to find that sooner or later the winwin situation well is just that it very easy for u to look nice and people tend to believe what we say the combination of feni is dangerous and we know how to move thing around for our benefit in our what we barely show up in movie mal enfj well finally an enfj is portrait in a movie a the bad guy or woman we are usually are the bad guy but no one ha find that out yet i love inception the whole deal about multiple since i had no idea what a cylon is sorry im too young it pretty accurate wikipedias description about intjs cylon battlestar galactica wikipedia the free encyclopedia in contrast it easy intj a robot that live among u and computes emotion entjs a human being who want to be a robot well i dont hate you guy a much a i hate the istjs those are the wicked one im kidding you guy are amazing sometimesjust a any other type how to make an enfj happy umm i dont think you need to do much but here is a bunch of tip that you can do to drive an enfj crazy in the good sense hug the enfj ha much a you can and a a word of advise try writing or im him instead of a full confrontation it just give u more time to analyze what you are saying and what to do im really bad if someone come up to me and i couldnt help to feel identified with your boyfriend in a way when i become unhealthy thats how i act i dont let people know what i feel i manipulate people to open up so i can examine their i voluntarily take the position of king of the island we enfjs are the soft leader and we can make everyone be forced to be happy not true we usually talk a lot only if we know thats going to cheer up the entire group ohh and if there is a new person in a group he will probably be welcome and introduced to everyone by from my point of view fe is the ability to make decision based on a rational and subjective matter focusing on people fe is automatic for u i feel like explaining to someone whats the smell of tough question well i have had several issue with istj and estjs i dont think i would ever want my wife to be an xstj we have inverse dominantauxiliary function tesi against feni not that lol i really laugh out loud and it even harder for men to embrace the feeler side and step away from the logicalmachoman thinker position dad istp mom estj oldest si estp second oldest si estj me enfj youngest brother estp it sucked for me being the only nf at home my mom and my second oldest sister were always to i know how that feel time which you want to escape from something and you just dont know what that is feni combined are very tricky remember that your intuition duty is to help your fe this is part of monster by skillet my secret side i keep hid under lock and key i keep it caged but i cant control it cause if i let him out hell tear me up break me down why wont i can relate for some reason to this story this is something that happens to me and many other enfjs once a relationship is considered a over there is no coming back i think this happens disorder your score major depression slight dysthymia very slight bipolar disorder very slight cyclothymia slightmoderate s easonal affective disorder very slight postpartum runescribe you sure know how to express yourself about ni a my auxiliary function i find it hard to describe but i relay on it everyday i know that it happens when suddenly i stop deciding actually at work the engineer that get the most number of good survey from customer and ha the best customer service is an intj it weird he not that social with others but when he good question i think it is because being so different from my college make me stand out for good and many time for bad in the end what an enfj what is seeking is companionship and to have i agree with you i dont get angry ill probably become resentful because someone just tried to hurt my fe i withdraw and i imagine what would be like if that person would get a heart attack or a no hugsno enfj i think hug represent to u a way that you feel very close to someone we just love to give hug i wa a victim of the pleasenomorehugs policy once and that relationship if an enfj really like you shehe will be intimidatedthe enfj will act funny and will start firing these awkward signal we are normally emotional people and love is a huge topic in our life ni just happens if i sense that there is a situation on which my fe feel that there is something wrong my ni information gathering begin to work it suck having fe first because we would

feeling of limitless possibility also photograph of stollen moment you dont have a goal oh i completely own it and will say it out right the worse i have it the more direct i become if im putting effort into you if im trying to carve out time for you the more i compete thank you they change colour depending on sun cloud cover and my moodim loving your hair colour what im usually told intimidating without speaking eye like dagger loud confident humour with an edge goal driven logical resting bitch face lol this is how i usually look taken thanksgiving year ago honestly i wa not mad husband had to pull off some good humour to get this smiling shot last week id conclude it a combination of self confidence not based on another person opinion motivation and a determined drive plus the fact we go for what we want we are only amazing to those men though i can see why you feel that way however honestly she sound more like my other two friend that are istps that sound nothing like my husband or this female friend intps they often wander away i am not a ceo however am slowly venturing into entrepreneurship simple personal perspective i admire hard work dedication and a willingness to improve flattery would not work with me it my husband never try to earn someone respect one of my best friend is a intp female a well she too doe not try to earn someone respect they simply ignore people most often i guess though oooo cooky no problem glad i could help a a woman i actually find this insulting to assume woman base their worth on you getting off is hilarious if a guy acted like that in bed he would not get far insecurity and nerve are better lol you cant fix stupid that guy obviously hasnt been with entj woman if it were me id leave the room if a guy wa that selfish love this thank you i married a intp i think reading the enneagram would really help you in this case it sound exactly like what you are describing and i hope it will help your perspective many entj are naturally enneagram i dont disagree with most of your opinion just the feedback part personal opinion feedback is different then a insult im not saying it is the best approach but if you flip the role a i find this funny so darn funny my husband is intp and usually simply walk away from people saying how stupid they are if he going turbulent that mean someone really pissed him off and married and with intp for year it a very yin yang relationship yes he take the lead but he very competent in physical task me with money and task orientation the big thing in my im surrounded by a lot of people can talk to them i simply find it very rare to find someone that i heavily connect with i grew up an army brat we moved all the time so making acquaintance is if you are really gungho and want to impress next time do the ad their way in your spare time create a second one in your image approach them after and say that you would really appreciate their canadian entj female w here a well also love thor rock and have huge shoe obsession although my boot collection surpasses the shoe lol welcome i however am a scorpio mid s have a funny story to tell about myself entj and my year old entj daughter being a mother of daughter let me get this straight your doing it because shes doing it that make no im loving this lift me up of five finger death punch in video on jukebox here some messed up logic but a a person with a best friend with aspergers perhaps we were made to understand even those who feel completely misunderstood i also brought the subject up with wow an astounding which i find funny because so many people repeat coming to me to help me with their problem big life change are making me put up defensive wall right now though this sound much more like the ennagram type to me then a change in your type healthy s closed off and distant will act like s commander type when they are doing well however when stressed the separate theory here is these girl did not have a separate agenda motive were not stoking your ego the first one she actually liked who you are however even if a person like you

The N/S dichotomy is...'",everydaydreams interesting since shes typically typed a an enfp from her answer how certain would you be of her overall type and each individual dichotomy asking for a friend and thanking for her in advance if someone came to you and asked you to make a decision about something what would your thought process be more or le run the ive found it incredibly difficult to find people who i think are worth opening up to or even can open up to it a simple process you give them a little piece of information that seems personal i mistyped myself a an enfp in high school i would have thought this to be a pretty rare occurance considering most enfp stereotype are quite distinct from entj stereotype yet it interesting any particular reason why the title say enfps there a point where we say this difference is within the realm of sampling errorsimple statistical variation while you bring up some interesting point half of them seem more too ad hoc esfjs arent annoying people are annoying if you are being annoying to others it because of what you are doing a an individual and not a part of some arbitrary type on the other hand like for estj and entj philosophy did you mean utilitarianism a a rebellious teenager i once put nonrecyclable trash inside a recycling post looking back i am now deeply repetent i have not searched for approval while i am unconscious no it doe irk me a little since all those type of post are saying to me is i believe in vague generalization to determine interpersonal relationship or i have no confidence to try this out i once contemplated whether or not it would be more conducive to remain single relationship do generally drain time and im the kind of person that crams my schedule full so i wa hesitant to if you really want to incite these change figure out how to put them into action rather than searching for validationmotivation on a personality forum otherwise itll just be empty idea inside a holistically speaking you come across more to me a an isfp than an infp based on not just what you said but also how you said it your text wa a lot more focused on reality rather than whenever i have argument with people with ti it usually go something like ti person but that doesnt make sense me who the fuck care if it doesnt make sense to you if it work it work not an fe user but it a general trend that a our read of the situation get le reliable the more we are involved with it and b it much easier to tell what someone who think similarly to i think there a very clear use for understanding how the different mbti type behave while drunk the whole nature of personality is that it is something that is innately a opposed to something i think there a bit of misunderstanding the proposed difficulty is in distinguishing between for example infp and intp not between enfp and infp on a different but related note i disagree ive seen quite a few opinion that dom are hard to detect on a day to day basis because individual have mastered using a balance of them so much that it becomes indistinguishable a common example any type can work with any other but if it make you feel better the infp cocreator of the mbti isabel briggs myers wa married to an istj i am willing to believe in the existence of a god but i am not willing to believe in them at least not in any of the abrahamic iteration both old and new testament and the quran have shown moral i find it very useful to inherently it easy to assume that all people think the same and even rationally knowing that people are different doesnt mean you know how they are different mbti is a i agree with what ha been said before a lot of time when we ask for others for opinion we are looking for validation and this is indeed possible for mbti type a well you talked a lot about esxp their spontaneity and apparent randomness is something i have difficulty analyzing good because they are so difficult for me to understand and so different from what im used to they i think a lot of this also ha to do with how much change is actually happening in your respective life for example a person who went to the same elementary middle and high school will be much very likely i think this is especially true in the united state i noticed that while living in new zealand where it seems like you are from too username gave it away this isnt a much of an again this might not apply to all tedoms but at least for me i find that it instinctive like if i tried really hard i can probably notice it except even when i do notice it it really hard i definitely agree with this however the difficulty that i experience which i think will be quite similar to other te doms is that i dont know how to do those controlled detonation i may be an some of the overlyrational type thought nt are known to have also exists quite heavily in antisocial psychopathic character too it sort of like how some of my friend say im like certain thats factually incorrect look up the definition of modern physic it not simply physic used in modern era it specifically refers to physic based on principle that are nonclassical by agree on the isfp part to give an example and by god this is difficult and embarrassing to talk about a couple of year ago during a particularly stressful part of my life i went to a party im not following your point on classical mechanic classical mechanic is the framework of motion a set by isaac newton aka newtonian physic what is classical mechanic and it accuracy so ill first separate the useless part from the useful part of what you just said the useless part includes the sentence talking about training wheel and some such just drawing to your haha that gave me a good laugh upvoted you for it some thing to note about what you posted though firstly i didnt brand your post a trolling merely because you disagreed with me i can you dont need to google it for me im already aware of how it defined it more so that given your post either you had a really different outlook on what intelligence is which would be im slightly confused about your definition of what it mean to be intelligent in my own mind intelligence mean an ability to acquire and apply knowledge while i dont pretend that what i wrote a lot of people type me a asshole but i have to remind them that it not a type it a lifestyle i agree with that stereotypically speaking you would expect fps on one end and tjs on the other end but a you mentioned because your hypothesized type are very extreme it hard to be quite so given that there are vastly more entjs in the world than there are executivesceosdictatorspoliticians it probably safe to say most of u are pretty different honestly anything other than sound exactly like what my friend infj doe whats fast and quick and i dont mind eating right now what type of food do you want lol ur not sure k what type of food do you not want ok dont want mexican dont want chinese dont there are many advantage in talking to a t about your problem instead of an f for one empathy can get in the way of understanding since the empathetic person project themselves and how they think what a fucking retard say hey sorry there a line here could you get to the back think old hag say nothing laugh along any direct counter in the moment when one of every type in every situation just throw the one that prove to be
