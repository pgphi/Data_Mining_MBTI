present itself in your daily life i dont mean such a falling into a grip and allowing it to take over i mean more of doe it have a small impact on your regular day just try to be friendly when you talk to others make sure you are genuine though ask them question people love to talk about themselves maybe others are used to you being silent and how about scan my surroundings to make sure that im not going to be the next dead body then check for pulse poke with stick call the cop and still scan my surroundings to make sure that i at least for myself i get bored quite easily if the conversation is boring i will be looking around the room for something interesting people say that im easily distracted but from my point of scenario you are home alone it dinner time and you must decide how to feed yourself whats your thought process and what is the most likely thing you end up doing hmmm im hungry i dont really relate to any of them the closest would be deredere but it doesnt really fit not sure what it all mean but for me it had everything open except sacral and heart which were underactive rootopen sacralunderactive navelopen i feel like i see my life a a merge of the two view one the one hand i would not be who i am now without my past some area of my life would need to be viewed in the whole to make sense like i think the negative stereotype of the esxps when they first encounter mbti just push them away from it im supposed to be some jock who is great at sport a an estp im supposed to have a thanks for your help i figured out im a w looking at the motivation of the type rather than the description help a lot yes thank you for not picking a monkey im not sure exactly why but ive never liked them i think parrot are the perfect choice this seems like fun here mine

see a bit of me in all of them and none of them have clicked it took a while before i could figure out my mbti type too so i think ill get it eventually xthecaramelqueenx thanks although it is easy to be principled in hypothetical situation sometimes we can surprise ourselves in reality shoulder to wrist thats a big one mine little and i totally agree with sensationals post i think she hit the nail on the head i too am super open in general conversation unless i am getting bad vibe i will probably tell you everything that is this seems like fun here are my response youre standing in line at your local supermarket and some teen cut in front of you what would you think inwardly do outwardly i would think how old are you where do you live midwest what do you do grad student studying math undergrad wa in biology what do you and your friend do together do you like traveling why or why not if so how muchhow important is it to you is it something you enjoy or something you make a point of getting a much a you can in i do love to travel i got istp i am prone to mistype a istp though while i do love shark i definitely relate more to their fox description im not sure independence and honesty are too really good one i dont know of one word to describe it but i really like ambition and contentment at the same time like you have goal but you mbti type estp gender male how much are you into gaming i would say they are one of my favorite hobby how frequently do you game maybe every other day more often if i get a new i wa homeschooled k and never had trouble in any class except for spelling one benefit from this is that i wa not allowed to go do fun stuff until i had finished my schoolwork it helped i very much need some outside stimulation a well the lack thereof usually just make me bored and sleepy after a while it will build up to a stircrazy feeling if it even continues after that i would say i get empathy pang too however they dont physically hurt me it more like a bad feeling in my gut the main issue that cause them for me is not so much unjust suffering though venting can be quite helpful eh i do not work well with people that i think are totally incompetent if you know how to do your job and are not a big box of complaining then i will enjoy i had mistyped a an istp before some of the reason why were i am usually the talk in the corner type at most party

while most of it is centered around reaction for me i guess a some emotion can be relayed back with rapid understanding ahh yup misconstrued information i can understand why he might of thought that a it very crude and restated thing for exfjs socionics which is why i sort of avoided it fi type may be for you well what wa it you didnt agree with well im no expert on the socionics i understand that it work on the superego the ego and the id however fe and si are both present at least are those function you identify with well i can agree with the stumped part ennegram wa a life saver honestlyfinding out i wa a w made alot more sense of the situation and the current mistype i have it say more about the person well im not exactly sure what your asking but typing in general is something that can be difficult to ascertain and ive had my own lengthy experience did you try by cognitive function also are yup by the way he is also the maker of the video i described that tals about the irrational axis yup by the way he is also the maker of the video i described that tals about the irrational axis well i revisited the function in raw mass from what i learned from the personalityjunkiecom and i also caught up on my micheal pierce video for scratch reference more specifically this one hey sorry i went silent for a few day i wanted to do more research on the ennegram also after talking to ghostfire and autsdraws were talking about it took awhile i finally wa able to figure why why must there always be something else so i double backed on fbbs post to see which site it wa ad while i liked the entp one the intp one sounded like everything i wa trying to well it great that you relate to some expression of inferior ni and thats the more important part i agreed with with the definition on funkymbti while others i wa a bit lost on ive actually ha we probably wouldnt get along well no need to worry about not being an adrenaline junkie sensory view can be very limited in the perspective that it assumes all se dominant are crazy fun well that wa really productive actually i wish id had the time to do it earlier a ive been so busy lately more importantly i think it said alot about me especially in relation to other intps this is true i feel like so many people need assistance with it and it is really hard to compile all that information overtime honestly if i didnt have kitty im not quite sure what i would i also it seems that a miscount for ennegram and other external stimulus and test direction seem to steer u to different character the whole reason for function using used is to avoid the subtle huh i guess that make sense i guess i really didnt understand that and have done very little ennegram work i suppose being a rw seems le extreme would make sense a the intellectual well you certainly seem to be someone attuned to their surroundings and experience and like to be caught up so you are most likel a sensor and you definently show some preference to thinking so im come to think of it i guess i dont have the cleanest spot record when it come to socialization my relationship can be pretty half hazard and are usually the joking kind if not the intellectual well maybe i have the same situation of just being another type in function just to test it i took test in a row with time in between and they all came out intp actually also im a true ah ok i tried familiarizing myself with it and i feel i may be either a w sp or sx there both really depressing type but i can agree to both the inner pain concept of the type and then the well i havent mastered or gained any significant knowledge especially in math intps seem to have good integrity for knowledge and focusing on that knowledge i know i have fe in

sadly or perhaps happily i dont remember the context i mean if i had to say i wa a specific type which i would rather not because i dont like mbti i would say estp or istp a the nearest best fit not a in i would actually pick themrolleyes am white i am female i wa educated at a prestigious university which included a minor in education in essence i am riddled with privilege do i belong in a classroom in a community of color have you seen my triangle theory of six hehe my dream job is secure jpg no but really yes i would do that even if it wa insecure i feel the problem with working for a company is you are doing nothing for yourself you are thanks yes they have and you can see some of it here in nd post a for my personality i do not think i am an entj if i have to choose mbti type i would choose estp or istp a somewhat i wrote this a long time ago and while i think the core of that paragraph is roughly accurate i would like to add that fi a an inferior is a more complicated relationship generally speaking i only by reading can one become a better writer i would say that all type are usually misunderstood by reductionism that wa a problem i had learning about enneagram especially when a lot of well meaning people try to explain it based on what i mean is this isnt about ideology and it isnt about group either after all even democratic type know that racism exists even democratic type can say hey racism is wrong and in for example there wa author on mcgill daily who demanded that innocent before guilty wa an outdated principle because it wa racist there no word for people of this calibre maybe i wa too hasty with gamma it wa unfair but there is definitely a psychotype of people who are just looking to cause trouble and are drawn towards subversive activity decidedly the irony is that i cant fucking stand these group of people i am not sure that it is aristocratic either the whole thing smell of special snowflake syndrome to me it is much more so you think that whatever system that you can devise would wipe out both poverty and crime overnight interesting it seems strange that nobody else ha thought of a similar system to this or that actually the evidence tends to suggest that the wealthier a society becomes the le crime it ha wordpress in the whole basis of the battle between libertarianism and socialism is so completely vast that attempting to lure people from one side to the other with an argument is almost futile i dont doubt this forum just hardtrolls me but i have to admit that from time to time completely alternative view have provided me with another lens it wont surprise you to know that i am one of the people who doesnt think they are homophobic but us gay fag etc all the time but they have wide connotation i agree that language can take on i am not going to take the bait of your very childish attempt to be patronising so i agree that conversation should end here the meaning of language is static that is why we have dictionary word do not change their meaning it only their application that grant them new meaning i agree that you can describe a fish that isnt how language work meaning doesnt change according to who you are talking to meaning is static if you didnt want to say that they were frivolous but you just wanted to say naturally i am just saying that your description of beta only being interested in frivolous social activity is basically wrong i am going off typing of sli for rand lii can also be it funny because i wa going to mention rand but now i guess there no need rand wa a beta btw thats what i mean by ideacreation rather than ideamaintenance er ok but usa is not a in other word you want to have your cake and eat it too well no not quite these are good illustration delta wswiki beta wswiki you can go and live in a hut in the forest if you want then yes there are aristocratic quadras a you noticed beta and delta and democratic quadras he i think that the interesting thing well firstly the heritability of iq is not completely known estimate range between and intuitively i am inclined to believe the latter however i would suggest that the difference im normally quite keen to put difference aside and say ah this is just a difference in thought process but this time i think you are actually wrong i understand you are talking bout any policy that involves more than one person is going to have to distinguish between different type of people thats how government function i dont think it true that value wa ascribed what of eugenics certainly not even sweden practiced eugenics well into the s im sure you know that very interesting i have seen dcnh but not come into contact with it that much at first glance i think i am an n but i cant say for sure let be quite

te or at least what is popular in your circle here is extraverted i know there have been the retard on both side of the political spectrum and had hrc won there may have been right wing demonstration i get that and i agree with bill maher in the sense that i you dont get that by being right when others were sure he wa wrong that enhanced his reputation not ruined it talk about shooting the messenger your not having respect for intraverted thinking jfk had addisons disease it is possible that his having sex regularly with different woman made him feel better like what hiv wasnt an issue then herpes wasnt even considered shameful whoa dedication let not get the anointing oil out just yet i thought trump wa an entj but he wa just a more mature estp than i wa mastering both fact and feeling unlike this estp he one of the thing about being on the estp board is that we get to be our honest but often offensive self estps arent living in the rigid world of j who have to have iron clad rule we group or in relationship there are two phase the passionate sexual love that last for a year at most and the hopefully long lasting comfortable kind for the stimulant phase enfps are great fun i dont think much of the advice given to you wa specific to your situation but general commentary on how tough estpesfp type kid are to raise and what is the best method to work on them malcolm that wa a great insight into our type i wa in total agreement with the healthy part but i wasnt sure about the second unhealthy part mostly because i wa afraid you were right and i sensational you know you are way in the grip here right it sick how much pleasure i derived from dropping her at my mom today fi i took a very hard road in life younger it way easier a an estp it doesnt matter who say something but whether what he say is correct ti and it is naturally my preference to let what i do and who i am to stay anonymous estps routinely look down inregards you are religious right the notionbelief you have is that you shouldnt have any physical contact with a guy unless there is an emotional connection and let me go one step further you one of the thing about being an estp is that you see thing so clearly that you dont get involved in the wonderful brainstorming session you entps do so here you have a wonderful discussion entps and estps share ti a the way in which we make decision we also share the trickster function fi a our seventh function and most of the screwup in my life come from not focusing on the that is a great question but i think it is not being asked exactly right seeing a how entps are ne and estps primary function is se i am going to use them a example what type are better at lily not that it matter because this is all theory but i actually am a doctor if you search for a thread on the infj board for a thread named an infj with ocd you will see many of my post on thanks for the post bob i feel sorry for this guy dj he came across type but is so messed up he cant even see who he is and how to make himself better this is just pure nonsense for example that is pretty typical with primary ni those hazy vision can be pretty haunting i pity the person who used their ni and came up with the concept of radiation i can imagine him or her telling the whole not good romantically is true for estps in the sense that it ha to do more with feeling estps can be good at this if it get u to a desired end ie getting you into bed but once we i guess i started this polyamorous thing about estps up so i will respond i wa married didnt cheat for ten year and really didnt want to wife wa pretty smart hard working kind isfj we lol okay i will bite first off and this isnt true with intps often when woman come around asking about estps it is because they are having problem with a relationship we estps respond in the translation i think i am missing out on life bc society tell me that long term relationship are more fruitful than short term one but they really arent for you not yet attention that is really funny when i feel something bad is going to happen i go into estp detective mode and try to figure what the bad thing could be the infj told me that she doesnt think like that and very very good nk you need to critique my story i want to know what i got wrong not sure estps do the whole impressed with ourselves jaw line thing unless that line is there for humor in sigh i cant talk about other estps but when i read this about why stay being a friend a in my friend i can give a million reason why even on this website i have helped people out with their bug is right nk he gave you incredible advice one of the smartest post i have ever read it easier said than done but if you do what he advises i think you will be a lot happier and this is the infj writing with her inner estp i pulled back the dusty curtain in my crappy hotel room of course i had to get stuck in god forsaken denver in the middle of the snowstorm i went to this course by dario nardi about using an eeg for type but we also had a fun writing exercise you had to write a story but pretend you were doing so through the eye of the other type i came back from a mbti type course being taught by dario nardi phd one fun exercise wa to write a story through the eye of a different type and he paired me with an infj she had to write a oh boy i am way too familiar with this type of conversation having lived it for year your girl is an isfj she get her most pleasure living in the past and that is why she is always imagine my college professor voice ahem now remember m lorena classic bipolar disorder ha to do with two pole extreme mania and extreme depression the manic is high in every stimulative cm that is an interesting topic this is in the personality page on estps a mental toughness which make them extremely hard to beat in any contest the estp will almost always be the last man i already know what happens with enfp and trauma they go on to ocd engaging in self destructive compulsive behavior i thought you were talking about your personal stuff not his so i animal i think you want feeling affirmation versus the truth you want u to say yeah we male estps are shallow pleasure driven bastard that will always cheat i dont think you are looking sigh here we go again animal i really like you kudos for you for being open to discussion even though you have been hurt by an estp i dont sense one bit of anonymity towards our type we hey animal i found your post really sexy which is kind of weird when you look at the written word i could you see turning many estps on but you dont get u at all you think you do but you i am sorry too h give the lady a hug dinner buy her something nice and tell her how special she is to you then get back to trying again

very hard to im just trying to explain that from a technical standpoint the chemical mechanism are exactly the same for love and lust and since there are in fact thing you can do to manipulate attraction that sound exactly like infatuation by the way i know fluent greek hahah while they might have different word agape and phile are pretty much the same thing and storge doesnt even getting married having kid or even conventional work should not be considered the default or something you have to do doing thing just because others choose to do said thing would be stupid while the thread seems answered i want to add that once you realise what love actually is the basic chemical reaction and realise that people can be manipulated into feeling that in many way honesty is key in friendship and especially relationship so clearly she doesnt belong your friend is probably attached to what she provides not actually her a a person and doesnt realise it you should never have been chasing others in the first place take a relaxed approach and if somebody is genuinely interested in you something will probably happen no effort or desperation regarding her child id say in this situation thats a part of her life that you should not get involved in also rude is somewhat subjective so perhaps she doesnt think shes being rude i do not doubt that you may be highly intelligent but clearly you have some issue with staying motivated on one thing long term i assume this is because they actually bore you and then you dont take the advice of the person above me thats nonsense you get nowhere playing petty game like a kid you dont need to ask to follow him just go ahead and do it keep a casual mentality i think the most important trait in people a a whole are honesty intelligence and a little bit of comedic worth obviously it help if they have good eyebrow too usually id leave a thread like this a long response with lot of different viewpoint and tip but sometimes you just need to step back and relax that seems all too ideal but it seems you give it make sense not to just pursue often it better to let thing happen if they do occur naturally have you tried enjoying nature or something soothing self reflection thats hard to say so many name it nice being in london though cause you always see the artist around casually and theyre a laugh anyway if you

video would look like you have no duty to tell her though just let it sit there if she ever get into a mess for it it her own fault i have a few little point to make here firstly some of your friend

keep busy and let the time pas perhaps study how human thought process work a bit more so you have more of an of course not different topic a fresh start no grudge by the way are you doing better

longevity is very corrupted because of this i find myself relatively always busy if not with friend or doing some random thing im running what if scenario in my mind but i need my cave time usually half a day or a full day completely off oh you xd im glad i listened to you and joined this site it fun i tend to read people body language without realizing it but i do watch their eye because they always seem to give away what they are thinking or what their next move will be i have rebellious tendency that seem to come out strongly when someone try to get me to do something i dont want to or dont see logical how do you view and handle theory theory are usually a jumble of assumption so i like to play devil advocate and poke hole on it logic with fact how doe your ti work in contrast to entps if you give an estp a hugit will be the best hug of your life tongue im swinging on saying estp but also entp sound very good a well to fit the bill that doe seem like a possibility he could want emotional input from you or his mind is made and he is asking for your opinion to weigh it against his i have realized there is no thread for this on the estp forum and am curious to see what everybody say i would be very distraught not only for lack of contact with friend but because i manage all my email acounts and various internet business account from it and i would be very out of my groove but not all but a good majority i fail to see the logic behind their action and choice you sound a you are familiar with my username where from and thanks everyone and no i dont have esp my keyboard suck and sometimes i press a key and it doesnt register tongue hello everyone i am not a avid forum poster although i do enjoy reading all the post in this one so i am a estp i am a i do not fully associate myself with most of society because most of oops on this one

need a cigarette'",it complicated i like to stay out late but i also prefer to wake up at am because early bird get shit done scenario focus on your feeling process here your significant other just ended your year relationship quite suddenly and with no apparent explanation up until this point you had both been im fast like that how are you incapable of having issue when you make issue of not having a issue well i called her to my place and told her that there not really emotion between u and we have our own thing and she agreed so it wa easy and simple yeah well that wa my question how to let her go but it done now thank you wa way easier than i thought that is a great idea and i see no reason why getting bank to back u up would be difficult at all but we could make it a whole lot better why dont we just raise trillion and share it wow such a smart idea sorry i just had to steal it gofund yeah that is what ill probably do no point in beating around the bush okay so ive been dating a girl for about a month or so shes nice and all but the relationship ha gotten pretty bland rather quickly now there this smoking hot blonde who stepped in she i use protein powder free of artificial sweetener because they make your body swollen i mix it with pure cocoa powder and high protein milk seems pretty obvious to me he wanted a friend with benefit relationship but failed to keep emotion at bay pulp fiction i would save the drug for myself to become immortal scenario focus on your feeling process here your significant other just ended your year relationship quite suddenly and with no apparent explanation up until this point you had both been dont try to pretend it didnt happen just occupy your mind with fun stuff hobby friend etc that way you wont be thinking about him all the time and it easy to get over it you can say hi when i just broke up with my girl last week after month relationship it took a day for me to get over it the secret is to just forget about it occupy your mind with something else i just cut all how do you express your feeling and deal with your emotion half of the time i dont recognize my feeling in the heat of the moment and if i am about to express my feeling it bound to be there is nothing more relaxing to me than drinking beer while taking a shower and listening to loud music who would stand up to wipe his as youll get shit in the carpet well my mate is a walking stereotype of estp he is really a patient zero or something then i got another mate who is more of a relationship person and he is not so much into fistfight but he theoretically it could have happened if theoretical me in theoretical party did not have such good self control this is just one of those what if scenario theoretical question let say i wa at party last night ad there wa one guy who get aggressive when he drunk i had not met him before and i did not provoke him in any way but he got angry at me stfu biach welcome weak of day of binge drinking i constantly get distracted iits fucking annoying and about being late check and the last sentence eah nail on based on that you could be esxp i wa wondering if i wa t or f but ive realized just tell u what the fuck are u itd make this easier i live in multicultural city and i know several first generation immigrant who are fully integrated to this society furthermore i have lived i have felt like this for few year i can become angry about small thing and sex dont really feel like anything and it wa like that even on my first time ive had several partner but always the yeahright exactly what i wa looking for you got my point y estp and esfp are very similar in many aspect i have tried to look for example about how each type would respond to different situation but i didnt find much i want my example the way i want your score from primary psychopathy ha been calculated a primary psychopathy is the affective aspect of psychopathy a lack of empathy for other people and tolerance for antisocial because thats the way it is baby you and me we are inseparable mbti debunked shocked from what ive understood this is not exact science yeah there must be some feeling in my decision making and i dont believe feeler ignore all logic in favor intj almost the complete opposite that whatsitcalled effect wa strong on me but im definitely not i or j for that matter yeah id beat the crap out of that twat who ram into me with a shopping cart but i would not apologize to shopping cart thats ridiculous this is how you treat your figment of imagination i will let the labor union hear about this mark my word wtf is this bullshit all i see is a blank screen you are lying you are all reptilian self sabotage yeah i am capable of having real human relationship im not a psychopath you put too much weight to stereotype that describe estp a exploitative and ignore others like being yeah well not exactly social anxiety but i sure get more self conscious but with the friend and especially with new acquaintance i am confident a if i wa high on coke talking a lot it is nice little ability to have for example this necessary evil i am at coffee table with my gfs parent and i want to give good impression so it good to be good at talking what would an archetypal estp be like in conversation ive noticed i am not a kind of motormouth a some of my friend who can talk for hour on end i am good at initiating conversation and in my country one can not just go to store and buy a gun just like that so yeah i dont bother i am joining the army next summer tho looking forward to blowing shit up with assault rifle and rpgs dear kkking nobody would call me a silent person because i have that kind of high energy presence but i give you an example where i get silent sitting for hour doing nothing but talking it which james bond i have to agree i am twisted a a corkscrew i have no clear moral principle and i have done bad shit but id still help an old lady over the street setp quite a few s here i think my strongest type is w but i behave like w almost a often well it look like an upside down face and some kind of muscle structure and baseball cap it dont make me feel anything my fried once told me dont worry whatever happens it normal my advice is play some good music for me weed wa kinda letdown i did not really have any strong effect other than being tired i am having

vote entj danny is an enfj trying to look like a leader it funny because she just isnt cut out to lead you can see it in her composure what she desperately want is to make the world a better place and i dont know if anyone here ha watched this but i like how they didnt change the character personality too much they more or le exaggerated each of their quirk in fact it seems easier to i watched it again i still think entj possibly intj and since when doe an istp speak in the way that bane doe according to mbti databank the most vote are for istp and for xntj i think he actually could be esfj but i think his character changed a bit from the start of the show i had to watch a few more season to see it and now i think it can almost go both way not esfp time to lay down the law dennis entj he just like eric cartman mac estp he us fe look closer dee entp like bulma from dragonball z charlie enfp most obvious one to me personalitydatabank enneagram and mbti typing site and this one ha her a entj but i would take both of those with a grain of salt ill try to post the scene in this or the game of throne thread in a few day well i read the first book of game of throne but i dont remember the difference between book and show i am talking about show because thats how most people have experienced these character olenna is an entj female that pretend to be the stereotypical esfj around men she doe this to manipulate them she want to appear to use ne because that is female charm but thats a mask and the movie wa absolutely terrifying a a kid bump youre avatar is wearing a suit so you have to be a tj also if i were to describe myself it would be straightforward sarcastic i see what you did there im going with extj take this key cognition cognitive process and post result we will sort you out wa a decent movie not the best of them but certainly worthy of the legacy thorin estj white orc estj smaug entp thanduil intj i think he estp but ive heard just a many people type him entp im inviting one of them to share their opinion alright you guy convinced me of entj for tywin what about daario naahris entp or estp sharenator well you might be onto something but that doesnt really explain it his wife death may have made him bitter or changed him but his behavior is still inline with what i understand a si and maybe well that settle it then given your profile pic i dont think i want to see any more picture from you now here something you may not agree with but im going to say it anyway because it seems the majority will disagree with me once again i think tywin could be an si user i just watched season yeah i worded that poorly i think jamie is estp and i think his lack of te is apparent i wa going to suggest the same thing considering the fi is so apparent tertiary te maybe ok maybe i have the fi and te out of order ne dom followed by fi then te actually make sense ne ti fe haha okay buddy and you should feel free to read up on common english idiom like

the same who design a washing machine for personal use that requires a code just to open the door i could see it for a commercial machine but one intended for home use yes i did get good grade in school im not a fan of school though i did enough to get by and get good grade i looked for shortcut i would glean just enough from the reading material to be oh okay thank you for clarifying socionics is interesting i could see how the duality relationship ha the potential to be strong my mom wa an infj i think and she and i had a close nope i commented on it see above likewise im not sure how my statement is a logical fallacy but if you say so yourlogicalfallacyis anecdotal fallacy truly fallacious anecdotal fallacy all the trope yeah it requires too much te i cant be bothered to be that organized im not sure what youre saying here i first read about it here natural type partner the theory go that we are best paired with a partner who share our dominant function but who use it in a different direction therefore i would like to meet an istj or isfj also they are supposedly plentiful in the wild but i dont seem to meet them maybe i should start hanging out at the library i tend to attract nf your experience is irrelevant to this situation though you cant know that it will happen again for the op based on your experience with your wife who happens to also be an istj every person is well then a couple of question you can ask yourself are when i consider feeling do i make my decision based on my own personal value system and how i personally feel about them if so you dear enfj thanks for the validation and i havent even told you half of the story cheer estp the function stack for one thing esfp se fi te ni estp se ti fe ni the two type use totally different judging function and in a different order that answer may be vague but if you interesting read from these description i can definitely see where i come in a an estp for one i despise reading the manual when i get a new gadget i think a ti dom person would be more aaaand this thread ha now turned into an nt circle jerk wink not really i always prefer se over ti whether people are around or not i think in my mind im thinking that im being some sort of cleaning dynamo and that i can get it all done when in reality im just creating more work for myself and nothing is getting done aw sad im so sorry gorgeous pup im sure heshe had a great life with you and your family sp here i just saw this thread yep all of the time not so much lonely but i do often feel misunderstood especially being female and estp i dont come across a m lonelyheart so i are any other estps nonproductive multitaskers i notice this in myself especially when im cleaning the house i will be in the middle of a task and then notice something else that need to be i used to play wrestle with my infj exbf until i hurt him and had to stop he ha an old injury from a serious car accident year ago that would be awesome first thought after typing that i am one weird chick i have posted something similar on fb no one ha taken me up on it so far do we not have this thread in here i cant find it if we do anyhow dear infj yo stop trying to act like an estp you cant pull it off you say you want to be friend with take this for what it worth but if youre into socionics your relationship with your hubby is one of supervisorsupervisee where you are the supervisor and he is the supervisee more info at i tend to choose wine over anything else however i do love tequila so margarita come in a close second delayed gratification i hate it

also say even if i adapt well i seem more introvert than pure extravert like even if i like to be center of attention and say speech and more extravert than introverts",haha i think this is it im a estp se ti fe ni i told a member of my family to read the description of estp and they found it mostly true except that long conversation and deep doesnt bother me ok thank you yes i think it but i think im not the stereotype maybe doe add have a impact on type ahh ok thank you i should have think of that it may not be the most selfish but they are more evident i had a crush on a girl and when she wa depressed i used to talk to her and empathizesympathize with her but i wa in need she wa maybe it ha been said but any way the type that may seem more selfish are the fi to me it may be just an opinion but more introverted fi like isfp or infp no if you know for sure that i use se ni type and not ne si then it is estp because im pretty sure that i use ti fe it wa only the first and the fourth that daily life like driving is not daily life i have a car you know not a camel hahaha explain what do you mean but can that be only my memory also my i dont know if it is si or ni but when i taste smell touch hear not see i naturally make a link with the smell and the place but it not always clear i know that i smelled yes but se is uncanny because i have add i may be daydreaming sometime also my sense of direction is not so great i am great with going reverse with trailer i can understand that you can feel impatient about this thread i will understand if you give up since you are the only here and even my best friend cant tell but he doesnt knowledge about mbti i dont remember i think i wa just scrolling through haha hahahaa in depends on what subject hahaha he said after discusting with him he said you a bit of everything hahah are you running short in solution ahah euh wait a second i dont usually talk with about this with my friend the third is entp too the second give me entp e n t p like this question forgiveness is more important than retribution of course retribution is unhealthy i know this for a fact but they will probably make the point fe so i end up with the first test is not good it say that im esfj or enfj and im not plus the question were so hard to understand i had to use google traduction ahha every question and im not a dumbass with the extroverted intuition crystal ball introverted intuition soccer ball yeah i think so but then i like to see what is hidden i thought the the fourth function is what slows you down in life but it not for me not in every way in fact it help me to be more well the moment you find out you reply to a post that is two year old bored hahah you must be quite desperate visiting thread and insulting people and hoping they insult you back hahah your funny though and also i always saw the estp to be like a dumb person who is not able to see anything more than what is physical and stereotype of total a jerk like the guy from back to the future you know cool so so se and ti help understand the mind and behavior and to know why and why and fe make the user able to react to it with social approbation from feeler and thinking thats ingenious i think ill make a new thread about the th and see if there is anyone like me soon ah yeah well thank you i always thought that i wa more n than s but i think i wrote everything that i could about me and you can make a conclusion out of it that is estp i really thank maybe im entp with good ni or estp with really bad si can it be yes ok that be the w then you are right but i am clearly between estp and entp i think i will never know which i am really even in the enneagram i cant be certain im because when i and why w i just reread about the th and it say like they envisage the worst scenario possible but i dont know much about enneagram so it must be since it after the w that may be because it wierd because i have a hard time with si but sometimes with ni both can fit my personnality if you consider them being the fourth function like i dislike being to much on the detail like paper well thank you for you time pifanjr can you explain why how do

a bold a you were i never had tantrum either you know that assbiscuits got kicked out of a kid club on holiday the organizer refused to take her back again and she you were a horrible brat of a child i think your cousin is an istp though p so many question what were you like a kidsi wa very girly i wa always bored i could never stay inside for boring read the whole thing to see if i could though clearly youre asking for something you dont want form here youre like a hungry adamant child refusing to be fed none of u here know you you could be anyone but youre also a person in my ni suck cry oh come on you dont have super power he doesnt look very tall enfjs use fe focus on your fi instead entjs use fi and fe is usually one of their weakest function edit wrong thread id rather be an estj so i could more done function wise you two are opposite according to beebes function palobell the shell crack dont you worry about it lol i do this kind of shit all the time to mess with people head here one you can try walk into a gift store and ask wheres my gift estps want to test law and break law entps want to test people and break the norm of society uhhuh otherwise they barely open theyre mouth from experience im really good at my capitol big head what the capitol of burma thats a tough one whats the capitol of vietnam ho chi nihm did he think i wa stupid or wa he stupid either my ne is pretty strong but im a sensor true and true and there nothing wrong with that exactly and i just said im not talking sexually no matter how suggestive that post mayve been well anyway i dont wait around for someone never have awww blushed this thread is so cute sure wish i wa in a tight knit community thingy and i could join in just saying proud nahh im not talking about sex no matter how suggestive that wa cmon guy i thought we were doer not dilly dallying bitch hell no it not working you mean that she wa a bitch the woman he wa talking about it wa ambiguous also i never called you sexist read my post again come back if you still dont get what i mean had a snow day with cliodna d no work hot chocolate jammies duvet the heat on full blast it degree over here so the problem is you dont use ti but se however youre not an extrovert maybe you use fi you need a tf function so what would you say it is referring to woman a bitch this is why you cant stay in relationship the entj i know life with me and spends a lot of time with me clingy isnt the right word but were always together l isnt evil but still an intp light is an enxj and ryuk is an istp i could learn a lot from you if i wa single sure why not nahh youre an intp now oo striverexperiencer your primary vals type is striver and your secondary type is experiencer the primary vals type represents your dominant approach to life the secondary classification so im guessing the girl isnt you nonsense i do something about it i splash her with my car to remind her to bring an umbrella in future i dont see any valid point she ha for instance of course one can be extroverted one day and introverted the other we do have two introverted function and two extroverted function if when you dont know what shes talking about p dude you deserve way better than that if someone isnt straight forward i know how painful it can be when you love them and they cant just tell you exactly how they feel and be honest or even fbi agentlol im good at making conversation but i dont talk nonstop or anything im not a loner either i found out she type herself a an intp and if it wasnt for her id never discovered mbti because she introduced it to her sister too who introduced this to me my bad lol red i think great post not that i know of a a kid she wa very emotional very soft very sensitive and vulnerable and kind id say shes developed more of a thinking side disregarding that maybe shes an intj with logic can be deceiving and you cant do a lot to argue with it because it can be proven and convincing youtube mathematics whod want to use that it still opposite day i also dont see how this relates to infp woman my new student and my girlfriend sister she ha me wondering what type she is shes very interesting i wish i knew her type the first thing youd say about her is she seems quiet stoic gifbin gifbin yup it opposite day what are you guy doing here i have an outie belly button i forget by
