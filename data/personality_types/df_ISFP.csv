send you a cyber hug i think you need one hang in there you will get through this all and you are strong dont worry too much about this limerence thing i personally think it is making a necessary threat is quite arrogant in my opinion and i find it harmful it is like feeling above the other and come from a place of power instead of compassion now i am not preaching i am sure you are a good person but that is what i dont like about estj behavior the lying my friend doe this too and i can not understand this and never will why not just be honest instead of love of my life is estj we are

would like best is to talk thing through and get closure surpressing thing would not work at all for me and id rather bring it in the open so perhaps that wed just wondering is exploring information like say collecting information from the internet a se function when somebody in the street pass by and catch your attention because you are inspired by the beautiful bright color of a coat and you

this bit of verse edit to add that i found it at infjcom my husband tends to take the fixing attitude about life i tend to take the serving attitude i have some i have noticed that i am one of the few people that is immune to his charming way when it come to influence though i am probably not a immune a i think lol he ha amazing power of i see a lot of my husband and me in sphereofsilences post above i am i started dating my husband entp the end of our junior year of high school we had a rocky romance through college wow i started out in the isfp forum and started a thread about organizing it wa politely ignored lol i let the entp in our house do the mopping he is much better at it than i am if i have typed my husband and myself correctly i am an isfp married to an entp we have been together since i am too lazy to do the math at the moment i would not call it an easy when i first took the personality test i tested a infp i guess i may be one but it didnt seem to fit me and the funny thing like handiace wrote i have some sort of need to be in the my husband is an entp the gender are switched here but maybe this will help we met in high school he pursued me which wa an abosolute thrill he once ran mile to my house because his i can relate to a bit of what you are saying i worry a lot about thing that i can not do anything about it will cause insomnia to the point where i am still awake at am and i started to worry i have a tendency to want to do everything myself too i do not work well in group i often take over the project and micro manage thing it may be that i do not trust others to do it up to my laughinglaughinglaughinglaughinglaughing for me i just like thing to be a certain way if they arent in that certain way i get a little obsessed over it i dont do this for everything just certain thing i think i am more when i first met my entp husband in high school he wa an overly honest person he wa fearless when it came to telling the truth and would often use it to shock people almost to the point where i used to pride myself on my abnormality i am slowly working my way back to that peaceful existence i think preferring book and tv show over people is definitely an introverted thing i my grandparent used to live in the middle of nowhere when they moved to a new house my grandma packed up all the thing that she liked and wanted to keep then they left everything they didnt

insistent the estp wa to go out and do extraverted thing and how much of a personal responsibility human dignity others too personal to share ivenever found fi to be fragile my husband is infj and his brand of feeling is far more chaotic than mine i personally relate to sias song ive got thick skin and an elastic heart i social introvert yeah probably if these were the only option i actually really enjoy spending time with friend ill carve out plenty of time to visit them and if they say even in passing can be i tend to type others by looking for cognitive function since fi is decidedly

have stopped if i decided to move away i think sometimes funny coincidence happen to me an i would not expect to hear you really worked hard you gave up all fun and relax in order to do this it wa hard but it brought great result congrats people always told me to be more quiet while speaking maybe because of misophonia because i like it and because in italy the other subject in my city aren t appealing to me i would have had to move in another city and pay the rent if i had choosen translation i would have in italy there are a lot of lawyer and most of them have relative that can help them so no you can t make a lot of money from that in italy except you sacrifice everything to study it in a i like it but i prefer other type of music what are the thing which you would not expect to hear said to you thing that would be extremely rare or just never are told to you i copied this from the infp forum i think i m isfp but there s also the possibility i m infp i had both result in online test among other result anyways i would not expect to hear you really worked hard you i use to think about funny coincidence in language example on a diet forum the girl often write i think and i think about the word thin which is contained in i think lol it s maybe thanks because of the grammar correction i meant you study mbti very good and seem at least emotionally involved in school and write a lot about it and mentioned your teacher in one post so i feel free to ask question thank in advance entj because writing short post is not spamming and you r acting like a policeman moderator without legitimacy also because you like to study thing and give people direction about what do to other isfp s or dreamer and creative people i think strong feeling and emotion and calling more than once a day even once a day is too much lazy i think by taking action and do thing in time not procrastinating and be more active i just think sometimes it s also health related the isfp type might let people stress them out to much without noticing it and they should go for walk or take more care of their physical every day we think our life pas before our eye without seeing how our thought influence our reality all the time while thinking we don t live enough we already live in the meanwhile it i usually use this informing style when i don t know what to say maybe he just wanted to talk or wanted you to tell him to buy the bread together or he wanted you to tell him to buy the bread i like asking question instead of answering them and often small talk doesn t bother me i like people who make me laugh i don t draw much even if i think it s funny i write sometimes anyways i wanted to say there are real good artwork here it s gorgeous i think some isfp s aren t artist in the conventional way they might be creative in their thought without expressing themselves that much in real life i know what to avoid call center selling thing trying to convince people to buy something you don t like that much anything independent is good i answer generally that it change during time i wa used to accept one night stand and relationship bored me but then i stopped wanting physical contact year long i see people saw you a an intj in the mistyping game lol funny coincidence it s similar to the type i mistyped enfp trying to change them by giving the good example often without success ignoring them and their sound what is difficult is to not show them you have a problem and being fake i m not i personally think it s so mean that it s really good sarcasm the path of symbol a i thought wa meant could be the attitude the isfp ha when dealing with other people and taking for i just found this personalitycafe i think this quote might apply to me what s the type in your opinion thanks that s nice from you thanks for typing me yes i m a little obsessed but now i stopped dangerous behaviour i had thanks to an online community about eating disorder and my weight is thank you that make sense lol d thanks that s really helpfull i think both have aspect that are similar to the aspect of how i feel it will be difficult to decide d i had the isfp result and then infp in another test the first one through personalitiescom the second one through key to cognition doe anyone else had both result cool that s one subject i wa not very good at in school why not the sight cool that s one subject i wa not very good at in school why not the sight i had summary analysis of profile by focusing on the strongest configuration of cognitive process your pattern of response most closely match individual of this type infp lead the thing about seeing bigger picture is part of the default anyways i would like you to type me if you have question maybe i m not any of them but something else

average female daily weight fluctuation this happens to me all the time though i do notice sometimes when im super busy stressed i will lose weight more quickly i think i sort of romanticize certain moment in the past which are usually serelated like being on top of a mountain or something like that but i think the longer time go on for me the more well i know why i dont use eyeshadow hardly ever it suck lol it always end up creasing and mixing with my eyeliner and whatnot even if i use a primer underneath and there no way im first of all you are so sweet the fact that you think about these thing and care enough to try and improve your interaction with her is so important and in and of itself it prof your this made my day xd thank you i am pretty boring i do the same thing almost every day moisturizer tinted powder foundation concealer mascara thats it make it easier for work in the morning and ive just gotten used i like this playlist but to it i would add youtube youtube youtube most of the post are year old if youll notice welp im not sure which test i did before but i just took the pottermore one and got ravenclaw it put both me and my istj sister in the same house lol i wouldnt have any power either way wait you dont we can fix that no overall are aok for some reason they dont produce the same cringe effect a romper i never liked wearing overall myself but i think they look fun on other people lol right i dont remember much about my childhood but i distinctly remember a romper my mother made me wear and i hated that piece of clothing with a fiery passion that ha yet to be matched is google stalking me the answer is yes very much so no matter how hard i try i can not take that model seriously instaugly lol i got slytherin for some reason i dont think my downfall are being sadistic or deceitful though xd i dont really fit into any of them but i suppose i resonate more with the strength of i have learned to expect a lot of people to not follow through because this ha happened so many time to me ill forgive them and whatnot but the next time i make plan with them i dont keep my i feel the most beautiful when someone notice my best quality and make me aware of them it easy to get caught up in how i think i want to appear or comparing every aspect of my life to others why on earth would you say that you go girl youll be a knockout for sure do istps dislike being complimented about themselves i have this one friend who always compliment me on random thing like my water bottle or my shoe or for making a strategic move in a game or yes omg that would be amazing my cubicle is on the third floor of the office and boy would i love to slide down story haha i have a strong attachment to this one kind of chocolate chip cookie which is good for you and is moist and delicious no one would ever guess the ingredient included garbanzo bean haha that is so amazing though love that idea lol i get a lot of random idea for various kind of invention which rarely pan out because i dont posse the skill knowledge to bring the idea to fruition but theyre still fun to think about i probably could figure it out if i gave it a while but it doesnt interest me so haha depends on why i dont like them haha also if i know them super well but dont like them sometimes im overly blunt because i figure theyll forgive me or whatever if i dont know them well and fi ni loop for the win yeah i wa going to say it is a combination of fi ni seeing something that would work knowing it would work intuitively and flying with it because it match personal value moral ni try to predict future outcome based on past pattern i suspect that we isfps use it mainly in a more sensory way paired with se we are usually more skilled at athletics or other thing that simultaneously that i would show too much emotion and that i wouldnt show enough youre a dull person you are so chipper in the morning i dont like your style all you need is art you should run for president i seem to attract just about anyone on a surface level lol which is super annoying cuz they are mostly people i dont find attractive maybe it more half and half and i just dont know because the i just now noticed that the title of the thread read sentance rewritethisthread it is seriously bothering me people who use my fuzzy blanket without asking so true though i dont know how exaggerated it is lol i pretty much feel like those thing inside i just dont always act on them my favorite used to be purple sort of like whenever someone asked me i said purple but i didnt really have a reason lol now it blue but i couldnt pick just one shade or tint of blue i seems like most isfps have young face i sure do ive heard that with a pixie cut i look older that wa like year ago though it not just about the subject themselves i think it more about what those thing allow you to achieve for yourself what ultimate purpose do they serve i think both of these subject promote control freakery i appreciate the phrasing xd yup all the time it like if a tree started growing it branch in wild direction making them tangle up it make me want to i love irish stepdancing if i hadnt done ballet i would have done that for sure i suppose i could still learn lol love the music too dad enfj mom infj im honestly still not sure how theyve stayed together so long they can be very

I wasn't sure I was going to be able to reach him, find the...'",i always come at thing from my own angle so here go look like i found my typing finger on this one over the year maybe with time come wisdom thats what we all hope for anyway or just because we are sensor doe not mean that we dont zone out and day dream okay yeah maybe what we day dream about is different but im not buying this whole package lock stock and when you can stay home by yourself for an entire month and never feel lonely or isolated and you consider having grocery delivered or in dennis the menace word two is company three is a crowd four is too many and five is not allowed substitute your own number lol i can relate to this my first and basic response is to be offended but that is useless lol so what usually work for me no matter who is doing the bossing is this bossy do this have it ready by all i have to say about this is head phone turned up loud put the brake to anyone trying to be social work great my grandmother wa isfj she did the most amazing cruel embroidery you have ever seen she wa also an extremely skilled seamstress she made absolutely amazing dress and outfit i do not believe that i am not creative i am not driven to create on a daily basis that is for certain but i have an amazing scrap book i have amazing child and i have been known to write a i wouldnt call yesterday a while and thank you i have talked to you all a lot here the last year or so and i just wanted to tell you that the love of my life died yesterday morning thousand of mile away from me i think i am completely isnt it so difficult to find that safety zone i think in many way how and when we reveal our emotion to our partner stem from the same need when it come to infj and isf that all i love the emotion of my infj they are wonderful and compelling it simply a matter of finding the person you feel safe with and allowing them to share with you when my infj say i feel let go of your negative and find your sense of humor it work anyone who think a polar bear is cuddly should get up close and personal with one see if they still think the same afterwards chuckle and now we know why an isfj would not knowingly pair themselves with an entj in fact i shun this type of person no need for such nonsense in my life i am very partial to my infj he is my hero take a while to find the comfort zone but persistence and authenticity are a winning combination my dad is estj what a nightmare i think it depends on their enneagram standing he ha his good point to be certain a very smart man but it come down to his way or the highway thing change a you get older people learn to appreciate the thing that are truly important it a waiting game of course we zone out get real there are time when i cant remember the hour drive home on the freeway i know i wa there i know my mind wa engaged in the drive and getting me here safely no thanks ill keep my infj strong sweet smart and ha respect for my own boundary perfect i think that is why i am so attached to my infj he operates with logic but the extraverted part of him is fe he communicates to me with his feeling and i cant tell you how good that feel to i met my infj guy through an online dating service we were both signed up for i had no idea he wa infj until after we had been talking for quite a long time he just kept saying that he lived ah the secret is out i wa never going to tell shocked you really have no idea until you have been there and back again all i can say is enjoy laughing never a luckier girl alive to have my infj partner nobody said it wa a walk in the park though my infj would tell you that i see deep into his soul when on the right course i see infp it might be more common to infj but it happens to me sometimes too my infj get that way here and there depending on the circumstance determines how long sometimes he can pull wow i think people are much more individual than that your temperament is not the entire you i think no matter what personality type there is always room for growth and potential just i find it interesting and insulting that s is automatically labeled a static if that were even remotely true the majority of our engineer wouldnt be istjs isfjs wouldnt have a knack i dont really think it ha anything to do with making friend and everything to do with boundary and not wanting many friend there can be trust issue sometimes too my love isnt you might be right dont know my daughter is and my love is the yr old is more likely to be social than my yr old he doe like to go to a soccer game or a basketball game i have identical twin one is infj the other is istj i think that combination for year gave my istj a looser idea of crazy and it gave her permission to be goofy with the rest of u turned out lol sorry didnt mean to imply anything sinister just tossing out my own observation from being up close and personal actually both my infjs have really fun personality they just raised an infj am engaged to an infj damned if youll find either of them at a partyever they are the one that prefer one on one contact if you see a person who come to the same restaurant isnt it wonderful to see one thing on the outside and know that the inside is anything but reserved and conservative i just love that part i love it when my infj get excited it so fun to when the chip are down and my day wa so bad when i feel the weight of the world on my shoulder and i want to lock myself in my room and cry the only person i want is my infj he love me i love all you infjs but i am not going to read all of your response and muddy my own water first of all i am isf i tend to be isfj at work and ifsp at home i am engaged to a wonderful i think at time that it can be almost impossible to imagine especially for isfj since we dont really live in our imagination the way say an infj doe it seems like we are so full of and i start writing thing down like a letter to my best friend whatever come out it really doe help i am no good with a journal but i am good at sending email to my love he is my best friend a typical intp sticking his nose into something he should walk away from please go elsewhere to cause trouble it not needed here i walk away from this forum time and again because of this how did what sjs think turn into an intp forum curiouser and curiouser a long line of my paternal grandmother wa isfj my mother is isfj my father is esfj truely we are a very screwed up family of that there can be no doubt but none of u ha ever used i dont have that much trouble communicating with the n in my life two of my three daughter are n my fiance is n honestly the n in my life spend more time being scatter brained with their sorry i cant answer that one a i am also a and have been told i may a well be an ist except it more complicated than that shrug human are complicated no way around it sorry but that just seems surreal to me i had a le than worse than ideal childhood and i have never felt the need to take pill or medicate that way i am thinking this ha more to do with disagree on the not being able to sleep being the enneagram i think it the fj part havent met one yet that ha an easy time with shutting down their mind so they can sleep at night isfj infj just because i dont let many people into my personal space just because i appear to be antisocial or isolated just because you read something somewhere that an extrovert wrote never heard this before and really i dont believe a second of it i think anyone can be a hypochondriac i think anyone can have psychosomatic illness i know that infj can get physically check out an istj they arent so scary pretty much big ole softy on the inside really just got ta crack that outter shell then again thats sorta like an infj isnt it love them entps are nutcase lol one of my best friend is one of them make ya wonder how they survive from day to day lmfao i am engaged to a very sweet and

cant help but think thing are going to get better when seemingly impossible theory and plan go through your mind and out of your mouth and other people often time when you ask an enfj about himself it show him that when he look within he see nothing but a black whole of nothingness it is uncomfortable and unpleasant we often dont know it important to stay a genuine a you can other than that just dont hold a many thing in and it will naturally express itself if you are around people that do not like you try not to i always thought she wa enfj when this happens with me i tend to get very angry suddenly seemingly out of no where i door slam but i also vacillate however it seems to me that the vacillation is only a way to get the person ask yourself who are you doing this game for if the answer isnt yourself then stop and do something else if the answer is yourself then dont let anyone else stop you with the right mind typological research experience and deep understanding of the function lol dont worry that wasnt that rude the point wa to answer the question or topic of the thread i wasnt saying entjs liking their ass kissed is a weakness i wa saying most of the other here are some real entj weakness that arent just entj asskissing a provided to you by your dual lose track of their environment entjs can be clumsy and especially forgetful often hi can i have my name changed to graphicallyalex get her to notice you then act like she doesnt exist and let her do all the work xd go on and try to tear me down i will be rising from the ground like a skyscraper well to be honest ive never had that happen to me but i could see it happening at some point i think a isfps sometimes we forget that other people have boundary we do too but they are um ive always been very sensitive to lighting in a room it either energizes me or exhaust me music really affect me if i dont like it i feel attacked almost and if i do like it it im not exactly sure whats going on but do whatever you are gon na do one on one yeah my inner monologue are much more typical teenage girl let me try to write an isfp version of what you just did here is a typical morning like today in class the teacher is well i know for me in order to talk about deeper thing i need something to hold onto a framework if you will like typology politics religion or maybe philosophy but im halfway decently you know your fi suck when you graphically project your feeling onto someone else without even realizing it wow i cant even imagine my te is my fis total bitch give me two minute or le and i can tell you how i feel about something a long a that pesky ni doesnt make me doubt it too much i say a lot with my word and i do genuinely mean what i say at the moment but my action can show a general description over the long term the action speak louder for sure but the word are my cousin is intj and i love her shes hilariously inexpressive and i often make fun of her for being the only thinker in our family she know all about mbti great conversation we understand hm well if youre not into him and youre sure youre not into him then i say burn the bridge just pull him aside and say stop staring at me im not into you anymore and if that do it do it do it do it d yes im chanting for you to me it seems like a misunderstanding and after reading this thread it seems like the op doesnt know how she feel about him i think it probably the same on his side a mysterious a we hmm id say it either they hate your gut they think you hate theirs they arent actually isfps perhaps they are intuitive i know our intuitive neighbor can be le direct and yes yes yes i completely understand i also get clingy when im like that it like on a normal day you would be hard pressed to get me to initiate contact but when i dont understand it all

little bit older i had a big imagination and made up imaginary friend for myself honestly ive known people of multiple different type that are lazy i have an intp cousin and he lazy my exfj sister is also pretty lazy actually so i think it really depends on the person enfj maybe tmlt always have to process their feeling before they can do anything ive never been in a dating relationship but when i dont want to be friend with someone anymore i basically try to just drop them and give them the cold shoulder yeah it probably not the best im pretty sure my younger sister is an esfj we mostly get along but we can get into disagreement we very very rarely actually get into fight i think one thing that make u clash is that she im a ballet dancer and i think thats pretty bad my foot are constantly bruised and blistered dancing with a big block at the end of your shoe isnt a easy a it look it also painful for just everyday i usually just use concealer eyebrow pencil eyeliner mascara and lipgloss if im going somewhere i might have to look more dressed up or something ill also use bb cream so something that i just realized that i tend to do is romanticize the past just earlier today i wa listening to music from and thought about how id love to go back to that time since i go back and forth between slytherin and gryffindor ive received both on pottermore but honestly i think i like slytherin more meh i just wouldve thought shes an entj over estj because she doesnt have a lot of apparent si warmth reasoning emotional stability dominance liveliness a lot of the time when i test i test a infj or infp i can really relate to the infp description not fully but it probably the next closest type to my own isfp i can agree with infj for the i agree with most of these the only really se thing about veronica is that shes into stereotypical esfp stuff like clubbing and shopping but i wouldnt say shes an sj shes more nt imo i ive seentaken this one before but it been a while infp enfp isfp esfp enfj i think it pretty okay but it just basic n v s e v i thing which is probably why an xsxj type probably tmlt go running when they feel stressed istj greek sphinx isfj genie estj griffin esfj centaur istp vampire isfp mermaid estp willothewisp esfp siren i honestly wouldnt have the patience to study law and getting into argument even if theyre calmer one doesnt sound like something id like to do very often unsure though quiet on the outside you are often the hidden hero someone who rush in when needed and then after the emergency is over fade back into the woodwork because of this sense of duty and there arent really a lot of people i dont like honestly i get passive aggressive with people that i know well and dont like i may ignore them a well if i dont like someone that i dont know they both seem like extrovert imo it hard to tell for me really because they dont seem to show a lot of their personality in video and im not that big of a fan rose doe seem more xxfp tmlt make playlistscds for their friend most of my friend are sjs and nfs i also have a few sfp friend even when i wa a little kid i told people i like all color but i think i did have this phase when i wa about six year old where i only wanted to wear pink thats about it in my experience intps are usually more lone wolf in all honesty i think i might be best with another isfp or another fp at least youtube i just wasnt super confident that he wa entj however i did a little more reading about him and i think he seemed like he had more of an nt personality than sj i think this theory is pretty accurate tbh im an isfp my sister is an esfj our mom is an isfj and our dad is infp my dad ha an estp sibling and an enfj or esfp sibling and their dad my im a female isfp im currently crushing on a girl who i suspect is an isfp it died a little bit since weve become closer a friend but it still there i knew her for a while before i for me at least it hasnt been very accurate it usually give me infj i think it pretty biased with question and it ha nothing to do with cognitive function however it gave some of my from what i can remember learning madison intp hamilton extj w more developed fi jefferson xntx burr nt again i get very easily annoyed by eatingchewing noise they make my skin crawl it easily my biggest pet peeve other more personality related one are people being fake people being huge slob this sound like something my istj friend would do so istj tmlt collect stuffed animal a an adult this is more for me around the age of i started developing anxiety when i wa about and i wa unhealthy and ive blocked a lot of memory from that age out what is your enxps and estps in real life anyway i feel like you can just tell theyre there they just have those vibe and other isfps arent really that hard to spot for me estp lol tmlt watch two season of a tv show in one day youtube

i havent been online in over a month maybe more i i feel so burned out from life and i want to sleep for consecutive hour i noticed there been a lot of advertisement for narcolepsy lately and i pretty much hit all of the symptom but im so my dad ha gotten back into smoking since i wa gone for nearly half a year when i first stepped into the house i thought it seemed a bit musty and the stench of cigarette is probably one of the getting back into the routine of thing ha been a lot harder than i assumed i feel completely drained of energy lethargic about some of my work but what cheer me up the most are the autumn i have been home for a few day now although it doesnt even feel like ive been conscious the entire time did i really take an eighteen hour flight and wake up in my bedroom this morning i am leaving chicago next week and a part of me is very melancholic and depressed because of it but another part of me look forward to coming home i managed to make some great connection here the fact that bjork is eccentric enough for one to cosplay her is amazing what made me smile today people walking their cute dog and letting me pet them plus it wa a nice crisp f ive thought about it for a while now and it thought that reoccurs ever so often but what is my personality ive been put on quite a few facade or persona for other people and i seem to i had some deep dish chicago style pizza today it wa awesome im currently on spring break from university and this is where the i dont really know anyonedont know what to do feeling kick in my roommate left on sunday to go back home and she life in i wonder when human started to cry for emotional reason it such an odd thing to do i dont cry much only when im in a manic state ill start cry hysterically hyperventilating and this is where i want to obliterate stereotype in term of personality type some of u have welldeveloped ni te and it not uncommon for someone artistic to also thrive in the math and spanx on spank alright god no i have to pause constantly to think of what to say next consistently say um inbetween word and i cant articulate myself well at all and yet i have absurd thought of hosting a ted youtube intp not surprising just when i start getting used to the time zone america go through daylight saving it in the morning and i feel so active still and my roommate ha been asleep since it also all of my attempt to quit the internet have been unsuccessful a i can never figure out how to keep myself occupied otherwise i actually find it perplexing a to how anyone can drop all medium im starting to wonder if all of this experience ive undergone is developing my ni more a ive been much more innovative and eager to work create formulate new idea verge a different path or i wa in video chat on skype with my mom and she told me to open the window so she could see the snowfall on the ground australian parent are weird i also kind of miss my family even though i im an undergrad microbiology major studying in prerequisite to biomedical engineering or working in biochemistry i work with a lot of xntps and i generally find the lab environment to be i wa a bit of a wallflower in high school though wasnt really much of an outcast i just didnt stick out anywhere might have i been considered cool or interesting among the artsy kid sure im usually indifferent but will become hostile if provoked it so fucking cold here im going to die and there someone who life in this residence hall who ha a cough resembling that of a chain smoker i still havent gotten used to this time zone they should be funny and more outgoing than myself and considerate of course we should be able to sit down together and have long fluid interesting conversation someone fairly laid back but the new semester of school start tomorrow and im certainly anxious but in contrast to how i wouldve felt if placed in the same situation say a year ago ive certainly made improvement i used to be a freelance artist but shortly realised i only liked drawing for my own personal reason and not anyone el i still enjoy drawing painting a well a writing and playing music no atheist sharing some idea linked with pantheism this ha been the most excruciating trip ive endured but im quite proud of myself for accomplishing it booking the airline ticket and speaking with the university packing my luggage travelling warm clothing right out of the dryer same go with slipping into a fresh bed after a nice hot shower the pitterpatter of raindrop on the roof lying in bed listening the sound when the i hate christmas and im tired of everyone asking whether or not i participate in celebration no i dont want to hang up any decoration no i dont want to go to any party no no gift renewed my passport yesterday am well on my way to chicago exactly two week from today to be honest i am completely terrified but knowing so is completely exhilarating i guess thinking four leaf are a result of genetic mutation in the plant which mean isolating the genetic mutation that cause the four leaf in trifolium repens and i think there a few grow your own four youtube incredibly surreal imgur i walked my dog around the park this morning if you find a four leaf clover keep looking depending on where the mutation happened developmentally they always today is my birthday except i havent smiled yet my mum bought wine and an other assortment of alcohol last night so guess what im having for breakfast now i just made myself laugh ha ha imgur imgur imgur ill probably spend a large portion of my life alone which im content with a i have to be but i cant help shake off the feeling that ill be inevitably alone both platonically and acquisition of knowledge empathy even if i have a very perplexing time expressing it but appreciate it a a core value intelligence compassion socialism i cant believe were the lowest scored ive been told to be quiet and ease up on the detail quite a few time hard to believe that an enfp and isfj have the same ranking a week from today ill be nineteen year old i feel old even though im technically not that old i feel like i need to get my parent a card and a gift rather than them giving me something my dancing is essentially a trainwreck ive never danced in public before and i dont really dance in the comfort of my own room either unless if i want to make myself laugh or something i am a huge music junkie and my taste is so varied even i cant define it but im extremely possessive of the music i enjoy and i only like keeping my favourite song to myself i dont want strangely im quite the chatterbox when im comfortable and have a tendency to draw out long sentence and elaborate on everything around stranger not so much im reserved and rarely speak up youtube ive been on medication for bipolar disorder since i wa and it helped surely a even though i have a very rigorous diet consisted of high protein and overall healthy food my disorder satie gymnopedies are very philosophical when youre feeling down youtube new year resolution are dumb because nobody fulfills them even a much a they like to fabricate detail i kinda set some goal for myself this year though like getting out more talking shuffled through some rack of vinyl the other day and found discount off a couple who and cure album my simple pleasure today is listening to said album first thing this morning

Your level of boredom must've been this high *holds arm up signifying how high that is*|||This is true... you are essentially comparing a perfectly healthy member of society(Michael Jackson in his earlier years) to someone who has essentially gone through hell(Eminem in his earlier...",if any other type could read me itd be infjs you guy are similar in a lot of way different a well but the same where it count i like being myself i couldnt really see myself being anything else although i do admire quality of other personality type that i would very much like to posse i cant complain though i think it just a part of who we are i dont even do it intentionally but it really affect my ability to make new friendsi wa better at it at school all my friend from school have moved this this this there is no way on earth i could do it my parent used to make me do it and i hated iteven though i liked music itself one thing that ha been annoying me a ridiculous amount lately bad driver the vast majority of people on the road around here either drive dangerously slowlywhich in a way is dangerous a well i hate public speaking but i look after odd kid twice a week i have to speak to all of them when they are together occasionally and i dont feel at all off by doing it in that context i we like to deal with thing like stress by ourselves in our own way just be supportive maybe get her a cup of tea itll say more than any word happy unfortunately i think youll need to compromise in some way there definitely is plenty of opportunity in the it worldim working on getting a diploma in networking to pas the time itll alright let do this another way what do you enjoy what are you good at how good are your grade at school how much money are we talking here no matter the amount in my opinion you should do what you enjoy and can see yourself still enjoying in yearsi went down the other road studied i dunno i can put on an act for work which is similarat a school if i didnt i would get walked over but frankly i dont really enjoy doing it id much rather be that really nice person who this is true im not a good friend with a lot of people from school a i used to be which honestly is a shame they are all nice people i think it because they have all grown up quicker than one question here i know i cant label a person by his personality type but if any of you isfps were in this situation would you be burdened that someone care about you like you are obligated to but if i care about it a lot i will defend itmyself doesnt happen all that much though unsure the thing is half the time we dont really know what we are feeling frustrating rainshower he is disconnecting from you because he doesnt want to get hurtits something we do a lot i politicalcompass apparently im pretty much ghandi laughing interesting stuff but my political view tends to change with the depends what sort of music but generally soundcloud and youtube is a good start if they are set up properly they are great for exposureif someone google your name they are the first thing to still happy i did it proud i want to live in a big city just seems like a great idea in my head ive never really lived in place with lot of people sad this this this dont be afraid to tell him what he is doing is annoying you he may not appear to react well but he should try harder to not ignore you next timei would not a much a i used to definitely still daydream almost constantly though keep me thinking id hate to stop thinking proud i wa actually diagnosed with it when i wa really youngi know im not the only isfp here that wa diagnosed with it either now that ive read into personality theory a heap i think it more i think im the first sensor to post here um depends what sort if it harmlesslike huntsman they look really scary but they are completely harmless then it welcome in my homeeven if they dodge ball is a regular occurrence on weekend for my employmentlooking after kid is great when i play with them i do exactly a you describe make me think wed probably be great guerrilla nice video interesting about the not sharing anything thats mine im guessing this is one of the case where our upbringing differ i grew up in boarding school so to survive you had to my god it great to see some sun again this is the most consistently rainy summerearly autumn ive seen how is the rest of australia doing i hear it cooler down south i have pretty much turned into what your friend is but i only have one friendeverybody else in my life sorta are acquaintance and i get to see him twice a yearif im lucky the thing is im saw a kid i used to look after today cutest smile everfrom her not me i wouldnt call my own smile cute who do you think i am and now his latest album ha been pulled from spotify urgh dry youtube i dont think it that we cant lead it just that we generally dont want to a far a ive found we are quite suitable in leadership positionswe can be incredibly empathetic while being able well i thought id do the same laughing dropbox my mirror wa rather dirty looked cool though happy bad habit procrastination ignoring people when i dont feel like socialising forgetting to do thingsall the time im sure there are plenty of others i could list a few good habit but im in until it get to a point where it too messy to bear then you go and clean everything up in one go i seem to be doing that every two week or so now same go for taking out the rubbish i just it seems u isfps have similar problem definitely relating to all the serious post here which probably isnt a good thing sad youtube well we have the same function just in the opposite order i guess it make sense we just dont have the arrogance of them laughing istj we compliment each other not perfectly but he is the only one who can get me out on a weekend laughing i dont really do this consciously i have done it before once or twice though it like slipping into a cross between a daydream and a dreamobviously not real but you feel everything must just not just mine it collaborative i suggest you try it out sometime think of it like a canvas with multiple people painting proud im not sure if this wa the best way to go about it not all of u own wacom tabletswhich would make this incredibly easy isfps should have them more than most type tbh and not all of u have id have to say yes i have a fair bit of knowledge on pretty much everything but programming and networking sometimes i question why ive spent so much money on technology laughing isfp here i used to be really bad with it these day however i dont do it much if at all im at the point now where i can comfortably cut my fingernail off most of the time it definitely wa oh yes they are out there but you can say that for any type really we are just considered a nicer more childlike one therefore it le expected it scary because i know i can do this essentially this im in this position with someone currently actually im not saying no at allim still being a nice and polite a possible im just trying to avoid her it probably dropbox dropbox flockdraw is fun laughing edit note that most of the above isnt all my artwork it all created by we are emotionally explosive to begin with anyway when our emotion hit u they hit u rather hard being an unhealthy isfp would add the chance of not internalising it like the rest of u youtube listen to this a few time on a loop it amazing loving game soundtrack music currently happy give u a comfortable situation and a topic we are happy to talk about and you cant get u to shut up laughing my god your level of boredom mustve been this high hold arm up signifying how high that is this is true you are essentially comparing a perfectly healthy member of societymichael jackson in his earlier year to someone who ha essentially gone through helleminem in his earlier

extreme amount of money, anything past 45k is pretty good to me, but my ideal job would be hitting 70k.'",still no answer no one ha add lol left handed hey guy it been awhile since i last talked on here but let get to the subject at matter when im not on my add medicine i dont feel a creative a when i am on it i dont feel very mmmm some of the time but most time no i can have a good conversation over skype with a friend about art or a concept such a religion to see their view and compare it with mine for insight into look for the one with the f and d in math class lol thats me unfortunately i take add medicine so i actually may counter act some of that constantly looking around at stuff that many yeah im pretty sentimental with stuff but i dont keep box of stuff rather just a few thing that bring back good memory i still go on rant and get mad at people but it tends to be all inside my head and not disclosed to anyone else many time people would never see me mad because most of my judging is taking place sometimes i act abit too nice for my own good but usually i dont have problem because i dont do anything to anger people but some people like to start stuff to amuse themselves i think because yeah where did you end up going jiffy lube and auto zone both should supply free engine light diagnosis im not sure if thats the same a engine diagnosis never heard of car x before a a yeah it probably wasnt the wiring that wa the cost it wa the labor unless you didnt add the labor to the bill you listed spark plug is usually about to buck dollar for a few i see and understand where your coming at but at the same time i dont think this ha to do with racial or sexist term i dont think im racist or sexist simply because my brain tell me what im we isfps a close cousin to the infp also ha a large penis but we also have overly large nipple no doubt ide be a potato in a plate of fish and chip the thick starch and plump grain of the potato combined with the smooth and salty taste of the fish will push anyone back to the day of the pretty close to you to be honest i love hugging my friend whom i love dearly i do try to spend quality time with the people i love but thats abit obvious if i like them why wouldnt i spend i can relate to serenesam considering i really only have liked white woman but i wonder if this is because i am a fully white guy who wa raised by a white mother and white father and have had all im watching you tube video listening to music on sound cloud and typing on personality cafe d considering i know random irl and know what he talking about our

the pay is yeah the craziest part i got the virus from a minecraft skin listing software on minecrafts main unofficial forum and my computer would barely work in safe mode and at got to the point that the this but you may need to learn abit about linux ubuntu before you start using it i had an mbr master boot record virus on my computer before and it demolished my hard drive even after i tried pretty much the entire soundtrack from dragon quest amazing d complete nostalgia youtube i believe that company that take advantage of a huge population of animal inhumanely for example chinese worker breaking fox neck and killing them from anal electrocution for their fur i can agree with some of the thing on this list but i can disagree with other thing i am unsure a to who you are defining isfps or esfps a i can see them a pretty different in some case oh yeah seeing nature is definitely a must have like i could not live in a place with no window or anything our desktop which i always use is facing our glass door to our deck and i always look this is actually quite an interesting thread a my house kitchen ha beenis being renovated for the last week and it will continue for the next few week my fridge pump that make the ice ill be more quiet and somewhat distanced i may try to talk to someone else to make myself feel better someone who is caring and love me for who i am someone who i can see is going somewhere in their life people with dream and aspiration people who have passion just a i do but something i hey congrats you made the right choice ever since ive learned manual about a year and a half ago ive enjoyed driving my car and every time i take it out it just a blast to do no matter i definately recammend you buy a manual it is very fun to drive a car knowing you have full control over it few reason why you should manual car are cheaper than automatic car because you man i thank god everyday for my enfj friend they always are encouraging and genuinely want you to succeed it so great i can never tell my friend enough how much he mean to me yeah ive heard a few word tossed around when i wa alot more shy but my best friend really helped me open up abit we often time feel most comfortable stepping back and just watching whats going i think people just really dont care that much the more light you have the better you see and it is just customary to keep it at full brightness you already said you didnt particularly care enfj my best friend is an enfj and he super awesome in everything but i do like myself quite abit subway eat fresh hmm let see well when i first got my driver license im presuming your not talking about permit i wa still learning how to drive the manual car my dad bought for me so it wasnt for a few hmm they may be better in school may seem abit more psychic but alot of the creative aspect of ni may have a stable background in the isfps i sort of agree with the guy who said that you should stop over analyzing thing why doe it matter whither or not we are in relationship alot of isfps arent in any relationship and are i think the reason she mentioned isfps is because you wrote in an isfp thread and shes saying what she personally doe and hoped you would relate to her answer a a somewhat similiar isfj lol i wa reading through everything you just wrote and constantly drew you a being an intp a well see the difference is i have bipolar so it will affect my mood system not my personality everyone is capable of getting that mad it just easier for people with bipolar my stress is abit a yours except i have add adhd they are basically a package and bipolar from my father so my list go negative stress i procrastinate a you do and begin also my best friend who is an enfj is a big planner of thing and we both do a sport together after school but im really bad with time management and stuff and this time every year for the past omg i totally understand you i have seen some isfps on here that say they are very untidy which surprised me because im very tidy and neat but i dont see being tidy a our problem like any opinion it mostly about where i live virginia ha million of tax for everything lol i want to be close

relationship with an iliintp girl i ignored it the jp switch is untrue mbti function are not the same a socionics function although they are named the same and i know a couple people who i gave the mbti test and came out a intp and have if you will read on over the next couple day you will see that socionics is a wellestablished theory just a established a mbti although league le popular trust me on this and i still what is truly novel is the theory a a whole it ability to predict the course of relationship between type rather than just focusing on cool type profile you are a definite ili man no doubt of that youre lucky we are superego relation i happen to be a seiisfp in socionics so we will be fighting in this thread for a while p what is really cool are the intertype relation and the quadras which are formed by your valued function it like one happy family yeah it not that faroff from reality but a you might agree a much more foolproof method is to know people in real life rather than looking at candid photo of them photo are onedimensional haha not all socionists believe in the validity of vi you need to get good at it it not so much the structure of the face and body a it is the body and face language of the person i know a if you are unwilling to distinguish between valid theory and crackpot claim fine but dont try to badmouth something you are afraid to look into these description are russian bullshit end of story socionics is not mbti so dont expect a mbti type description how a socionics type description work is how through the block of function socionics is a vastly superior system to mbti bro and i would disregard all this intj have rounded shoulder nonsense immediately this is not how socionics work check out wikisocion for what i just demonize the person haha but all the advice i can give come from this quote you miss my point i very rarely tell a girl i am interested for fear of being shot down but i will spend all possible time with you so you will make the move yourself i dont even bother with yeah i feel for you find a new girl man one who wont treat you like a bitch party slut girl are gross i like your type of woman better dont come to me i will come to you if i like you simple a that youre cute yes you are compensating for your heartbreak man watch out i would be wary if i were you man but it your life you are crushing hard and i myself am subconsciously compensating for my girl haha yeah i treat everyone with respect which is rare in our society today that is a really cool story man i really liked it i can string verse together and i love color yes in a sense i am indeed unique even regarding the other isfp i know i dont feel they know the real me at all this is all i can say that is otherworldly i myself have a hard time with well since i have never considered myself an artist i use my fi to make judgment regarding my friend and family what i feel to be right regarding how i treat them and think about how they treat no if anything i would imagine isfp to be one of the more grounded type of the sixteen i see thing how they are and although i may idealize thing a bit i am certainly not in an otherwordly the idea is you dont want someone emotional since you yourself is emotional but you want someone who can open up to you nope you are looking for an entp this isnt even type related the girl is sick congrats isfp have that ability but relax man i doubt she is the one either but who know gauge her a time go on i myself have felt the urge to replace the intp with any girl at all and i a you can see from my signature and my avatar i love color and beautiful thing but i am terrible at art i am going to college for a degree in biochemistry that must suck oh man out of the frying pan and into the fire your friend dont understand how you feel about her do they they arent very good friend if they make a mockery of this but it is irrelevant you are working to forget about her now i well if he get a girl he is going to feel a hell of a lot better about himself but yes he need to relax about it if he is like me he know he deserves more than what he is getting but a lot this will be painful but it will be worth it you can bet your money on it that make two of u who are repressed i deal with it by firmly believing that i will find a girl who accepts me for this type of wisdom only come from experience this is the only reason i dont regret trying to get with the intp for a whole year i learned thing about relationship and woman i would have never you got ta tell her the truth you need to get your mind into a position that you will be able to do this tell her everything all the pain you have suffered you cant have her hanging around with i missed your last post i would get out now no matter how painful it may be she ha a boyfriend and you are only hurting yourself by hanging around her trust me on this yes i have just gotten through this i got over it because i realized she wa just wasnt right for me i had to tell myself i cant talk to her anymore because i wa so attached to her and it wa anything by light will get an isfp choked up since she is an isfp listen to this song and let yourself become a dynamic a the music ever changing youtube light face up i used to i know that is a big turn off for you i would stand up for your principle he probably isnt a great a you think if he abuse alcohol like that

she seems to never remember anything lol i will even describe what room we were in where we were i find it funny that u isfps arent really able to help much because we simply have trouble identifying why we do it ive never really thought about why i need to be alone i think it just help exactly thank you for taking the time to help judging by what you said she definitely seems like an infj she can never recognize any song until it get to the chorus lol im always the one who recognizes yeah shes been saying that shes an isfj it the one she test into more often but i know she may not seem like one it nearly impossible to type her she like to say shes untypable thanks for your input and btw she really did sit down and try to answer these question a detailed a possible to help people to type her shes generally just hard to understand i understand the sun cancer caring motherly intuitive sensitivea lot like a pisces sun moon leo firey emotion dramatic dignified stubborn lazy pisces rising im sure you know the trait lol omg so true lol i didnt even realize until recently how much i valued honesty but it mean everything to me i put it up there with trust if you arent honest with me how do you expect me to trust you of and to answer that last question i think i along with many other isfps are somewhat difficult to get to know due to generally being more private and tendency to open up to a select few so i know immediately whether or not im physically attracted to the person it would take me no more than a week of hanging out for me to determine the type of person they are and whether we would be personally i understand the rebellious stereotype i hate being told what to do who to be what to act like etc this may have something to do with being enneagram type though the i dont know if i would refer to myself a aggressive however if someone want to start an argument ill finish it i dont get physically aggressive but i will yell if i get really irritated by and are prob infp lol yeah i used to think that i wa an infp even though i tested into isfp repeatedly because i remember reading something about isfps not being very academically smart i immediately figured that i am a cancer i love astrology but there a lot more to it than just your sun sign yours being aries if you look up your birth chart it will help explain your personality so much better than isfps love to cuddle and be affectionatebut they need time to be left alone also isfps can be very confusing especially in the beginning stage of a relationship im happy to hear that everythings fine now i actually laughed when you said he popped up at your door and you lol you dont sound like an asshole at all i had suspected that there would be an obvious issue between sensor and intuitives we are vastly different sometimes it not that we arent i love this is going to sound weird my strength i am able to overcome anything pretty quickly and bounce back from everything having learned something to make myself a better person i love i tend to be attracted to either enfps or infps i find enfps hilarious and infps are easy for me to understand infps and i have very similar interest and get along really well ive heard that vedic birth chart are supposed to be more accurate than western birth chartsbut personally i like reading my western one the vedic chart usually just move each to a sign next exactly i have literally said this exact thing to my sister and friend i seem to have no interest and i feel like it would just bring unnecessary drama into my life maybe that is the problem there a trend with me dropping friend out of my life seemingly randomly but now that i think about it it not random i start noticing difference in how we omg we have such similar chart thats so interesting to meplus i also have aquarius ascendant in my vedic indian birth chart what about isfps annoy you guy im really curious to hear what you think you wont hurt my feeling btw just be honest what about isfps annoy you i really want to know what other type think of u dont worryyou wont hurt my feeling just be honest emeli sande read all about it youtube great i will be making one too a soon a i get my hand on a camera i thought i wa an infp for a little while and i just discovered i wa an isfp about a week ago im still trying to study the some thing have been weighing on me heavily for the past couple of month that i just want to get off my chest why am i incapable of maintaining any type of relationship for more than a couple ill start it off by just posting some pic of myself you got corgi quite simply youxre a darling people are mesmerized by your charismatic nature but you never get too caught up in all that praise you know how to just be you at all time and why are there so little video of isfps on youtube i already saw this question posted by an estp i think somewhere else but why i get that it would be uncomfortable for some people or you feel hey guy i had my sister answer some question to see if anyone could help clarify whether shes an isfj or an infj her test result are typically all over the place but she seems to get these actually thats true i would guess that she is either an isfj or an infj but im leaning towards isfj because she come across very warm and expressive also i find that sensor in general esfjshes def an extrovert i really want to make one but i am a little shy about knowing that people will watch and analyze my every move i would do it but i dont have a camera i have been really curious a to what other isfps zodiac sign are i dont know how many of you are familiar with birthnatal chart but it something that i am extremely interested in if you what doe the stereotypical isfp face look like ive heard before that we typically have an awkward smile or some sort of unconventional facial expression but idk if this is true if any of you i wanted to start a thread to see if anyone had any funny gifs or picture that represent an isfp if youre not an isfp feel free to join in i would love to see them all thanks for your thought i kept trying to tell her that she seemed like a thinker because of how objective and logical she is shes definitely an introvert and i am pretty sure shes a sensor too

Why?...|||which questionnaires, from where?|||Right all of you gave me great insight. i was just asking out of curiosity since sometimes i find myself doing the same thing.  I imagine it happening like me being a sponge and sucking everyones...|||Yes I was thinking that too.

Do you guys sometimes, just bottle everything up to the point where you feel numb and not react to things around you? That happens to me a lot. Does this happen to any of you?|||yes, it's probably true. I did have a bad experience with 6 before. yeah, I don't get bitter or resentful, for the most part, but I am very stressed. Specially when people don't listen to me. Thank...|||Is it natural for us 6's to always be angry with everything.

me however i got gryffindor take lot of deep breath what ive found about myself is that im good at a lot of thing i think sps in general are good at just picking up something and being decent at it now this isnt ah tei love you and hate you at the same time i find the older i get the more my te come outwhether it is being organized and businesslike at work or getting fed up with people and i have an extj bos we get along and have similar sens of humor but his energy leaf me reeling and wanting to hide in a corner after spending a lot of time with him i personally prefer isxj intj you have inferior se rely on ni and i can read te and fi trait in your description of yourself sent from my iphone using tapatalk yes i definitely relate to those description of negative behavior so that would mean im either an isfp or infp but which one well last thursday i wa in charge of an important breakfast a in the vp of the university i work for wa there i got there that morning and nothing had been set up like it wa supposed to there im getting a feti vibe so i would say either infj isfj or intp hmm im getting isfp from what youve said do you think that fit lol you sound like me i thought i wa an isfp at first then i toyed with intp but im not sure of anything i know that im introverted but i have a hard time deciding the rest if you could help me out that would be great thanks what aspect

alone to recharge introvert battery and looser structure that will make you happier ive dabbled in quite a few area ranging from music to psychology to web design right now im finishing up my it degree and working in that field for my job helping other people satisfies my fi also you can look into online resource like coursera moocs are a free way to gain knowledge and may be another good option especially since you are doing it for fun i actually have been reading that book however like you said she doesnt offer much advice on how to avoid it i think another reason i have been suffering from grip episode lately is because ive been reading how stress can affect isfps and how to brings to the surface our extraverted thinking i recently got promoted to a full time job at my local university i enjoy it but there is a honestly it doesnt sound like youre into him a a person more of the idea of him if youre not into him that much now why pursue the relationship longer i

that youve been in contact with painting at young age and been thanks a million for all your input this is so inspiring the thing is for me that i really feel i am here on this earth to express thing to communicate something and it is totally new to me i woke up in the middle of the night sweaty and my heart full of anxiety i dont know what my talent is and if i dont try to find out im gon na die one day without even knowing myself or having i get really mad inside but usually i just fence off and leave the place at least mentally i dont see the point of arguing loudly injustice is the topic that trigger me the most i just cant i think it really depends if you find a topic or an area that fascinates you think about what youre interested in at reading or what kind of documentary you can

mbti test i wa amazed that both turned out to be isfps too and my brother a well all isfps it i relate too what a great thread and post i wa single until age i wa too shy and too busy to get into dating and stuff and then it hit me at since then the longest i wa single wa this whole general idea of romantic love feel very dead to me having a binary norm singlecoupleforlife of relationship is

all the beautiful moment with my kid i see them growing up my heart and my eye fill up with unconditional love in an instant i dont have any major problem to date or chase a partner of course im a bit shy sometimes and my heart race when im really attracted to someone but i dont find this to be special to isfps actually i read the isfp is a serviceoriented person who defines their personal worth in some part by how happy they make others this is typical of people with the feeling preference the totally agree and thanks for your detailed input this is teaching me a lot both about the mbti type

sentimental i see gentleness in his eye estp can be so gentle and sentimental maybe his t and f are my new estp bf lied to me about his age he claimed he wa he is really the fact didnt add up right eventually to me i confronted him with what i found and he tried to cover up my favourite colour is not a standard colour it is a particular shade of pink with a tiny bit of orange mixed in it is called coral or salmon pink sometimes it is called rose pink next a predicted by you guy yeah i think mr estp is falling for me and i think im also falling for him themartyparade to me kindness is being gentle patient with me giving me space never saying cruel insensitive thing to me not critical being encouraging and supportive being sensitive i have difficulty with my bos he is always barking rule must be respected to the team and i will in my mind think fuck you co i hate restriction he always bark to the team the chase is still on thx firedell for ur reply do you mean hopefully he will tire of the chasing game with me and settle into a stable relationship so when he want to settle with me mean the chase is yup im doing just that testing his patience so far he doing well i myself need a lot of persistence too to keep on holding my ground not easy i wont sleep with him just to test it out im too isfp for that im sure there are other way to find the answer diphenhydramine wrote perhaps you misread or i wa not claer he refers to himself a mine you have to give your his name eg peter a treat so he want to be owned by me too yes i think he doe like me he expressed happiness for me when i said i have found the apartment that i want to buy and he said i have to give him a treat small one co i am going become hi guess what estp is still going strongly after me and i allowed some progress and you are right he really enjoys the chase and even proudly said to me you girl like determined guy so what happens after estp ha gotten what he want what are the sign that the estp need to know he is progressing maybe i dont feel we are progressing because perhaps im looking for emotional connection and there is none estp guy are not a per my earlier thread an estp is after me many stuff i read about estp say that estp is insensitive and selfish and also smooth talker the estp that is after me indeed he is smooth my ideal guy he is a smart a me im very smart ha a well paid job that he love he doe not have to be very rich but he must be able to live comfortably and have extra to pamper me a dear djarendee well is this a challenge for him i kinda suddenky growled dun touch there annoyedly and pissedly at him when his hand crossed a boundary yesterday he stopped but he wa im into both i wa into him the very first time i saw him and at that time he hadnt even asked for my number yet i think he is estp because he is very domineering and pushy with physical intimacy he cant stop holding my hand cant stop kissing me he demand for kiss in return if i ask for any favour hahahah whats the entj like what doe the entj do what can isfx do to stop that i wa treated like shit all my life because of my isfj super unhealhty mom you can love them if they are not your bos or parent or teacher i hate him i hate him i hate him i hate him i hate him i hate him i hate him i hate him i hate him i hate him i hate him for micromanaging me i hate him for constantly badgering me i hate him ive reached a point of my life where i realised my relatinship with my enfj dad is seriously fu cked up i feel my dad and i are very emotionally distant from each other we are sooo polite to i think im dating enfj but he could be esfj it wa our rd date and we got intimate he asked me if i could give him a blowjob but i negotiated and gave him a handjob after that he said i just dated my second enfj guy lotsa sexual chemistry we felt comfy with each other almost immediately the previous enfj it wa also easy to have a emotional connection and yes i dress enfj male are supposed to be rare but yet im dating my nd enfj male plus my dad enfj so thats enfj male in my life ive gone with with al time so far he is very warm and on second thought he may be an esfj co he a worrywart and he reacts dramatically to thing such that my colleague secretly say is he having menopause today he ha bad hair day literally possible co today i saw a dramatic reaction from him when something didnt go a he planned and he reacted strongly and upsetly at a colleague my colleague told me that he can behve like yes kinda i can sense he ha a lot of nervous energy it a if disorder is a beast to be slayed it like a fight or die response he can be stubborn and when thing are not going i like him so far i respect his knowledge his skill to organise his confidence his consistency his straightforward honesty his impartiality etc im drawn to his groundedness i dont see i need to get more opportunity to observe him outside work environment to know co i have only lunched with him twice so far a six worry a lot is his workaholism and wanting to keep tab on if we use eenneagram then i would say that he is likely to be a one he strict and fastidious and impatient i think he is estj or perhaps he is balanced i have a istj friend this istj is very calm and not very assertive and become an account rather than manager but my bos seems to be very i have a bos who is very strict he go by the book he is very sharp powerful memory check everything in detail he would make me sit with him while he go through the report in i have cycle i have cycle when i dont meet anyone for a while and then suddenly i feel terrible i would then start calling friend up and go on a social spree and then i would then yeah i got a good esfj guy friend there used to be some kind of attraction between u but were just good friend because of the age gap exactly mths but i have helped him destress before he ha even expressed appreciation to me for the support that ive given him he ha also said that he feel comfortable with me and can to update i decided to cook something and tell him that i would be delivering it to his place but he said not today im stressed and tired would be late from work too i wa sad and my esfj good guy friend doe not show openly the caring feel about him he abrasive and blunt but i know he is caring deep inside him which he show to a few yes i think he really a great person im very proud of him i have never felt proud about any men in my life before ok i will get him to cuddle me and then i will communicate with him yes thank you you have given me courage to initiate meeting him more funny i sell too when i want to ask him out honey ive cooked something nice i cooked an extra portion for you can i drop haha i guess i have to try harder than him i used to buy my own food at public food court while he got his own then once he wanted to get for me i have turned him down the next time he so far he ha paid for my grocery he insisted always pick up the tab for meal but in public food court i try to pay my own however the last time we met he insisted on buying my

help you with something like this you cant ever really tell whether someone is lying without some sort of prior reason to think they might be lying someone there is a lot that go into skepticism the scientific method openmindedness doubt free thought logic and bias etc i could send you some link if you want them it not too big of a deal so long a it not really someone thread with personal information there are some thread still around from so i dont think it too big of an issue at least it overlord sigmund hast spoken request denied thesinkholelawfirm probably the debate forum indeed yet the only one ever talked about are all nonsense such a truth stuff i dont recall seeing any conversation about a legit conspiracy since ive been on this site and what would a lot of people who posit conspiracy nonsense dont tend to think it conspiracy nonsense thus having a separate forum wouldnt at all help considering that the conspiracy theorist wouldnt affezwilling and resta um i have moved the debate to a new thread personalitycafe everyone think they are right about the thing they believe in if they didnt then they wouldnt believe in it the issue is that many people have to be wrong a most belief are mutually if you are going to continue to spout all this out then i am going to have to come in here and debate you but seriously though could we all stop being so condescending and stick to the topic dont think we can do that i didnt see an option for it well then while we are on the subject who here can teach me japanese xd what do i look like a moderator or something p make a thread for it and i might consider sticking it i installed ad block a soon a youtube started their whole ad thing so i had no idea you had put in ad xd is it per click and when do i get my monthly check p i kid i kid yes it often doe this is generally referred to a bias bias can lead u to interpret thing falsely or even potentially correctly the idea is to try and remain unbiased when looking at or personally i dont exactly agree with the whole all biblical interpretation are equal argument it simply not true either your interpretation is right or it not i think what some people also happy i quite enjoy the new notification function i dont see any problem with it being in the bottom left corner id say people just need to get used to it being there which might take you know

thing can an isfp do to get more in touch with their ni what doe it look like when they do the infj i know is very aggressive he feel easily judged by the world and turn that back on those he anticipates conflictwhich is nearly everyone he ha a hard time making friend because he thanks i dont think youre sound harsh or any of that at all he really is being crummy about this i am actually fairly mad about it i just also understand that most of the problem come from his yeah i just saw him last night at an event he essentially said a little to me a possible others said they got the same treatment i think the most i can do is talk to one of his other friend he did take me aside a few week ago and talked to me about it though i think it ha escalated a bit now there may have been some newer insight since but when i explained to him reason why he yes thank you i figured it tended to be something along these line i feel horrible that he taking it tough i wish he could find away to see this whole thing in a way that doesnt leave him oh me too i do understand that it might mean the end of our friendship is coming i just know he getting hurt by this whole thing i dont know how to make him see that he doing it to himself i wouldnt talk to them to in order to have them relay my message a a soandso said im just fairly sure he wont listen to my point of view from me i would just ask that they try to get he kind of an atypical infj you guy are described a megapeaceful he like raging and shouting though normally it not serious just troll raging i think it ha to do with the environment thats pretty much it more info on the whole situation a huge thing is that he used to live in our dorm last year now he doesnt with his new dorm he decided before going in that he would my infj friend ha been really sensitive to feeling left out of the group the last couple of month he threatened to just stop being friend with u entirely because he feel like no one is getting different result on the test are more likely due to the condition in which you took the test i got five different result from the test i took online when i started simply because i theyre both equally horrible on economic policy right with most social issue left politics suck how doe one cheer up a heartbroken istp he say normally he just process these thing logically and can get over them however this one is taking a toll it probably just need timesince it he doesnt make it clear that he just stressed v legitimately doesnt like someone anymore ive seen him stop talking to people that he no longer want to be friend with it very similar to he most definitely and estp very much so an e considered him being an i for a moment once and it wa so very very wrong he just act weird sometimes diphenhydramine i suppose that would is there anything i can do to help him get out of it will he even listen to me i dont want to bring it up and then have it come off a accusatory i just want him to realize that he hurt people i have an estp friend he a great guy i love to be around him there just one tiny problem ive noticed that he ha the tendency to just shut down almost everything around him when under the op isnt using the word liberalconservative in a political context though it about our interpretation of scripture i know an enfp girl dating and isfp guy and from what i can tell the girl is the clingy one why not just joy then joy is a wonderful name for a girl for a boy i might go with peter christian i wa raised christian quit for a while and found my way back because it wa where i always belonged i respect other people for their belief though and dont try to shove mine on im scared of setting expectation my feeling change easily ill like a guy one day and stop liking him the next im scared to initiate anything because im afraid hell see it a me leading him when im angry i cry i hate people seeing me cry so i go get angry in a room by myself until i cool down and blow off some steam then if the problem is still an issue ill try to talk to the before going to college i dyed my hair teal one of my closest friend today wa an enfp who sat down next to me at lunch and said you have green hair and i think thats something i would do if i firedell ah i know awkward silence are the worst i feel like i know what im talking about when it filling the void of an awkward silence but i just need somethinganythingthere apparently i have a habit of talking a lotbut only with people im really comfortable with it a simple equation the more im comfortable with you the more ill talk around you so we just paper lily ah then i guess my understanding of ni if wrong i had a feeling if one of my understanding of function wa wrong it would be that one thanks for the correction that make a lot well being an isfp or an infp youre looking for which one youre auxiliary with you could also try to see if you relate to tertiary function at all an isfp us se and ni and an infp ne us hmmm maybe example would help i wa talking to a friend about mbti once and i pegged her a an exfp i tried explaining s and n to see where she fit in i even tried to explain se and ne main difference between se and ne is that se deal more with concrete information and ne concern itself with abstract an se is aware of their environment and take in information through their pretty much any by regina spektor youtube youtube i dont think we actually are working towards anything in particular we just like to enjoy the present kind of the point of an se if you ask me kitteh i would say that isfps make from my point of view the inferior function is often the one that we lack in my life te ha been the weakest aspect myself im not organized or disciplined when im forced to accept decision what firedell said understanding the function help a lot i found that i dont even have to mention the test to some people to find their type if i know them well enough and observe properly i back home im friend with a esfp at school it an enfj estp entj and estj who id consider my best friend beyond them i know and intp isfp enfp infj istp and esfj it weird im actually interested in hearing this too but not fi and she make to many subjective decision based on feeling i support dany a an feuser i see infj in her and then she still name one of her dragon after him the way she reason it though is not the mark of an fi i relate to her in every way other than the fact that shes logical especially once i picked up the book and started reading ill be my response to whore on arya and on tyrion i agree with renly viserys just shout immature j to me but im not determined on that for catelyn i think she seems to use in a fedom impulsiveness is in the se side of her i relate to that there are part of her narrative where she is very rational though she keep quiet around the other night watch because she logically i dont see fi in arya not at all she make too many objective decision and her pov chapter dont sound like the working of an fi child shes also not and esfp because she doesnt behave like my new favorite tv show is game of throne and im currently working my way through the book i thought it would be fun to do some typing here starks ned istj catelyn xsfj i lean towards yeah it could be age or it could be the isfp seaux function creeping in on u we do like living in the

And overall they have better conversations with F I guess.|||At this moment not very cold :) It's still winter and its already 16 degrees. Not too bad :)|||Wauw Epimer! Thank you for your sweet message! That's a warm welcome!!!!! :)|||I grew up as a happy kid, worried about nothing, I had a lot of friends, but I enjoyed playing on my own or with a close friend most. I could play for hours with the barbies or something else. I was...'",i know two couple wich are isfp esfj so far so good so musicislife there is hope indeed and me and my not boy friend are also a great combination we just feel each other he is someone luckily havent noticed it yet with my esfj friend i know three esfj boy and they are just the best i wish i had more around me proud exactly started a very good friend because we can communicate very well and than developed feeling exact the same thing you name is also what i liked about the esfj boy and complementing she doenst say shes not attracted to isfps she say she hasnt got any experience with them i know a few esfjs and they are just like musicislife said very supportive loyal and caring yeah i recognized he need it a lot im dating one for half a year now and he say he ha never been so happy because i appreciate him so much he ha never felt so good about humself so thats quotelenabelle the main way i can tell esfj from enfj is realismpessimism i tend to lean toward pessimism and see potential consequence for certain action which mean im firmly hello everyone are there any esfjs here who likeare datinghave a boygirlfriend who is isfp i am really curious about the experience i really like an esfj guy we are exact on the same they are yes esfjs have very strong emotion they can be totally happy or totally down just from one little sentence or something someone said ive experienced it they are great awesome people i it is possible indeed she is an esfj she sound a a wonderful person i think one of the most important thing between you is that you have try to be open i always find it very hard to open up haha this is also a little esfj like p giving themselves compliment on a modest way i think to get the appreciation they wanted but i like to give them this appreciation cause they are very very hey esfj boy where are you i wan na see you proud thats funny or weird my brother is intj and we are like best friend we get along amazing ever since we were young isfpintj in this case work great pity you and your father are not like this all the time esfjs tend to like me a lot i do like them too but i want to hear from you esfjs p it funny you say this they are not too loud for me it actually a good balance between too loud and too quiet i think p maybe it diffirent cause im an isfp girl maybe it diffirent the i also thought our match wa esfj some site differ about the match i tend to like esfjs though anyway you say it exactly the way i feel it people say give him a chance or give me a could be he is esfj so very caring personality is just perfect for me but for some reason i dont find him attractive enough i guess i hate myself for thinking and saying this he esfjs are very caring always helpful warmhearted good listener good speaker p energetic loyal i just love you guy id say isfj how often do you think about your goal and value in life i dont and if i do it very vague never concrete i think about the moment and not much further unfortunately i do have some sense thanks mdogg for your reply but i am sure i am not in love i could have him if i want but there is something in me a feeling which say i dont want him not now not later and about the i agree esfjs are awesome i dont know what exactly it is but i feel so drawn to you you are all so kind loyal openminded funny open dont judge caring warmhearted and i can go on people can never figure out what i am like sometimes they try to read me but they are wrong when people dont know me they think i am quiet and shallow but when they do get to know me i weird dont get it everyone ha something if possessive is everything i mean they have really good hart maybe they come across emotional which they are but they are very warmhearted and esfjs are sweet very caring warmhearted openminded dont judge open can laugh with them dont know what it is with them but i love them i would also say isfp i at least connect very well with them and they with me i can get along with esfjs very well i just love them the only boy i really connected with were esfjs so i do think im attracted to them theyre personality match just amazing with mine doesnt sound isfp like i totally understand what you are saying i have this too i like to have friend but i dont really really need it i also dont need to catch up with my friend every week once in a while is they hate when people give up quick should i or should i not well okay than here it is akamaihd like to see you all hi twig i totally agree with you i have to say there are some isfps i know which are not very intelligent but i dont think it ha a lot to do with type it just that an isfp would do le absolutely method a nice introduction welcome welcome hi there amen tine so true i always say why do today

every enfp i know fun hilarious downtoearth and very caring people at least the one i know sorry for the confusion my comment about mainstreamcounterculture wasnt in response to yours more just pointing out what seems like a common misconception do you mean like a role model a in you need to do something so you think about what someone you respectadmire might do in that situation and actively try to be more like that person hm not sure if thats fefi though im a pretty big people pleaser and i care about what other people think fi may be particularly vulnerable to criticism of their judgment a emberfly said how would you say ni appears for isfps i struggle to understand this myself sometimes ill see something and a connection will just pop up like oh that must relate tomean this different silent onedge concise tend to slam thing dont yell at the isfp or push their button take a deep breath and just say alright im just gon na go cool off for a bit depends if there may be trouble with conversation that get too theoretical without concrete information or anecdote to ground them so a discussion about isfps and intjs being relation of activity in my apology didnt mean to get off point im not a parent but ferroequinologists advice seemed really good particularly about removal and timeouts those killed me a a kid it might help to eh i dont know maybe it would help to take the mbti out of the equation for now i dont know if the function really develop so early aye dont worry isfps are capable of having deep discussion just not when theyre forced fi reach the same conclusion just differently i suppose the first part of that sound right that fe judge by external standard but along that line of reasoning fi judge by internal standard i dont think authenticityinauthenticity really factor not sure the desire for affirmation is inherently related to the function it sound more related to the enneagram for instance enneagram might seek out affirmation that they are important and not sure if overcompensating to be the toughest smartest etc is related to the function the function are meant to explain cognition not necessarily behaviorsmotivations so se involves the se come up when im in the moment absorbing the sensory detail in the present moment in this case se is often tied with fi a beautiful environment or song can

being last man standing when the ai is stupid and attack whereby i squish them under the boot of my expanding army crazy but hey if theyre up for alliance im all for it game like risk total war etc do you play them if so how do you prefer offense or defense do you try to predict enemy movement do you have a game plan i usually start with strategic arm myself and those around me if no weapon are readily available make some gather nonperishable food item in a safe location barricade the house wait for several day see what happens who and a glorious day that shall be muhuhaha muhuhahahaa

realize it wa such a big problem until i started taking medication my personality ha changed so much on the outside ah in that case in that case im not sure i would consider isfps particularly more cold or aggressive than infps but i think isfps are more physically expressive they are generally described a whatever criterion you are using to figure out your type should not include how good or morally upright you consider yourself mbti is not a measurement scale for virtue he wa just cool i mean he wa the wa the useless cop throughout most of the show but he really turned it around at the endin a somewhat crazy way im not a fan of his english voice touta matsuda from death note i dont relate to him much but what a baller mikado ryugamine from durarara wa a remarkable character a well he is introduced a an awkward simple kid but i had to go through a similar situation i think going to a therapist is your best bet even if it just for you your mom will eventually have to join in the session i used to play a lot of video game when the n and gamecube were around these day i only play starcraft no not in general paraphrasing my previous post i dont get the sense that intuitives are trying to make me angry that part about people trying to anger me wa more in the context of a sometimes i take joke seriously when im not supposed to but that is not a specific issue with n it tends to happen with other sensor too other than that i dont have any big issue with other my isfj mother is perfectly content just sitting in the back patio for hour during the afternoon sometimes she sews or read a book but she spends most of her time staring into space edit sorry tough week i dont enjoy losing money these are exactly the kind of presumption that cause isfps to mistype i dont know how many member have seen the infp description but taking into account that stereotype are too im majoring in computer science i have to finish my calc and physic too fuuun dry calling oneself an apatheist doesnt necessarily make one an atheist the belief in god existence or nonexistence isnt necessary it is just the attitude that it probably doesnt make a real do you speak mexican i like writing more but it is a painful process it is rare for me to meet the word requirement for written assignment even though i usually get good grade on them haha i dont do writing or my bos is istj and i can tell the lack of confidence bother herwe get along fine though the only problem i have is holding a conversation with her you feel the need to edit and reedit your sentence long post i didnt find your post to be offensive just bear in mind that many sensor are starting to feel very suspicious when people start to make generalization about type lately it ha been more im optimistic a well what is so strange about human having their flaw i am incredibly reserved with people i dont consider my friend i dont look down at them ive just had many bad experience trying to open up well i do to notice the wtf expression on people face when they first meet me it doesnt bother me a much a it used to though and i tend to get along with anyone eventually i honestly think you should break away it not healthy to suppress those feeling for long period of time sure she is going to be upset but it cant be a bad a what you are going through right i wa referring to this part specifically intuitives tend to start from the top then work their way down to the bottomthe infp could convince himself that he is a t then begin looking knowingly maybe a couple but i think that example is describing more of an nesi processwhere the person is looking for fact that agree with a pre established idea imo isfps are likely to i love nature a much a i enjoy eating it and it delicious now i feel guilty touching a sponge is like the noise of nail on a chalkboard laughing hah when it seems to hard to say the truth i usually put up a closed smile and say nothing and hope that people can pick up on the hint yes it frustrates people but i really dont want to make whoa how did the op go from infps dont tend to be emo thats a stupid stereotype to isfps tend to be emo laughing ive come to realize im too expressive for my own good no matter what i say the frown always come out people immediately know when im not ok with something i dont really dislike anyone but i monster is epic watch the sub though

life friend and vice versa i dont think ive even told anyone in my family about this site either there are some i think many personality type do this sort of thing sometimes i get overwhelmed talking to or being with certain people so ill take a break from conversing with them for a while ill usually youtube do you like kid why no to be honest i hate them theyre loud theyre needy theyre immature and insensitive and the list go on and on some of themespecially the toddler are i dreamt that my dad wa hoarding cigarette into his bedroom and lying to me about quiting smoking weird thing is that he quit like year ago and it my mom who is more likely to do that thanks so much yes i see it yeah i did this a lot when i wa younger then i started getting into a teenager phase where everything wa useless and i felt i wasnt getting anything from it although it worn off since no one mentioned calvin and hobbes yet i used to be so obsessed with those guy for a kid who cant add single digit without consulting his classmate first he come up with some pretty yeah youre right sometimes i get ti and se mixed up for some reason oddly enough since theyre both really strong function for myself never mind d you know youre a sensor when you notice something that no one else seems to acknowledge verbally so you assume that everyone saw it and you decide not to say anything about it either later on that sound like a xxtj thing to me i think i posted this one already youtube actually the song thing isnt that weird the lyric of a song are easy to memorize because of all of the thing involved in the song the rhythm the lyric background music basically everything how enfps are inferior in every way to istps that or sparkly unicorn xp yeah same here theyre more likely to be good if i tell them without thinking welcome to perc i enjoy using white noise when im studying it help me concentrate more and also help blocking out background noise is it just me or do istps have the inability to quote thing i cant seem to quote something word for word unless if i study it extensively but people like my younger sister always seem to get it im just asking this out of curiousity im an istp i hate kid too young to have any and barely even if ever converse with them that and i rarely have opportunity to do so and a a i hate the legally blonde movie but i love this song youtube easy for you to say havent you read the istp and smiling thread istps have this annoying tendancy to never smile or our smile come off a uncomfortable and ungenuine ive been told in high school that i glared at everyone in the hallway which apparently wa why nobody liked me funny thing wa i always zoned out while walking to my class and my not paying when i wa younger i used to pick up worm and make the girly girl scream because of them i played alto saxophone in high school and still play the guitar my family is very musical so i have a good sense of rhythm and can read music sing well etc yeah this happens to me sometimes too it probably because of the personality type of the other person or maybe you were talking about something that really interested them sometimes youtube argh i cant stop singing this song w youtube welcome to perc i like how your name is march but you signed up in april d youtube yeah i have a similar problem if i know i may need help sometimes have trouble admitting i need help to others because at that point i figure i am capable of handling it by myself only when i i think that i is the trait im most sure about i actually came to this site to learn more about mbti type which wa caused by going on a few website about introversion and extraversion tuna one day that song wa in my head all day long i love it xd youtube this is the only version i could find on youtube that is not a remixbut she youtube i dreamt i had to go to a desert with two of my friend for a pancake eating contest whoever won the contest would win a year supply of pancake the loser would never get to eat pancake again i youtube i love her she also doe a cover of both side now and may it be youtube i wonder how thing would have been if this had happened when bush wa still the president youtube if i finish an assignment a day or two early i will completely forget about it sometimes people in my class will ask me when it due and did you finish it and ill be like we have an youtube the hush sound is awesome this is one of my favourite song by them youtube

not better for u one might argue though that human are in many way the most advanced being in nature that s who originated from those who formed a the result of a splitting one i am not making it a

thats why we call you introvert extrovert isfphappy the whole concept came of the idea that everything is of pairsor that every single thing divide it self into and then each of those two divide into two and it go on we see this i think most type s will fall under the introvert extrovert category if those type s are still in high school tell them to get enough of that life style while they are still in high school and even to some extent early year of university but there will topcatlsd you are a w you now ive only came across one isfp type and it wa online and she wa a w i think that a

am more confident typing her the introvert introvert type this is a good example of an ie intp v ii intp introvert of all the story posted here about infjisfp relationship the isfp guy in this story is the only real isfp the guy is sooo isfp though showing too much affection in public is kinda weird how do our cousin the introvert extrovert one come across to you i find them slighly more interesting because of the slight difference i guess and tega a little correction it not extrovert introvert isfp it introvert extrovert isfp extrovert introvert is for e type for instance within esfps there is the extrovert introvert doublepost skrillex introvert extrovert isfp vera farmiga introvert extrovert isfp but between the two group you relate more to the introvert extrovert type it may be that within that group you are more the introverted one and that each group then divide itself into therefor more like the introvert extrovert type instead of the introvert introvert tega you

it is the pair and the opposite feeler v thinker s v n j v p every function or personality ha it two pair for instance the joethebull i am now safely building an empire in my head it surrounded by unfriendly empire though mikan you would be one high queen your estj queen assistant would topple you while high in the word of great rihana but no matter what youll never see me cry cry is sometimes a relief it better private though an isfp kingqueen what would heshe be like i feel like ruling the galaxy right now let end the era of isfp musician and begin the era of isfp ruler infjs really like

or experience form of art maybe that also count in a way a being artistic o ah exactly what i wa trying to say in my post above you definitely said it better than i did luul c i have one friend who i believe is an isfjeither an isfj or way le likely an infj but anyway i really really really really really really really really like him more than i you remind me of clive owen c entjs and estps oo welcome brandon another infp writer eh haha have fun on the forum i have always seen that live and let live idea a more of an isfp thing same thing with the not wanting to tell others what to do just an idea for you they are daa bomb eh c it wanted the excitement sure to be on the other side im in the same boat and understand where you are coming from though i am an isfp i think that maybe it could stem from not being confident yourself in what you are able to do and just who you definitely need to get to know you first but i think i can usually tell just from observing a person wo talking to them how much i may like or dislike them i hate it i usually refuse to repeat myself if they werent going to listen the first time chance are they dont care anyway and if they accidentally missed it i just hate repeating i too have an isfj friend im interested in getting to know better but he is extremely private ive never met someone besides myself a private a he i am hesitant to share what is happening with hallo pitchblend welcome to the forum c doe your username have any specific meaning just out of curiosity ah any male isfjs want to answer x sound exactly like my infj sister and i haaa okayyy thanks for your reply c perhaps not but just out of curiosity im wondering c my sister will tell about how her day went and exaggerate what really happened like crazy ex if soandso wa

healthy variant and turbulent type are unhealthy variant i cant tell you much about turbulent esfjs though since im definitely not an expert on the type i can see intps and istps getting mixed up but estps are more like esfps and entps are more like enfps in my opinion im dont think esfjs are fundamentally insecure what about the assertive one insecurity is something that only show up in turbulent personality of any type i think requiring external im not an esfj but i just thought that id say that i really like you guy a lot i think people hate turbulent esfjs since they resemble the bitchy cheerleader most of u had to deal with in high my best friend is an esfj and well the term best friend should probably already tell you that i like her very much if she wasnt there for me i would have probably jumped out of a roller no i wasnt being serious thats just my way of criticizing anothers comment i actually dont particularly dislike esfjs but rather like them my best friend is an esfj and she wouldnt be my w w w sxso it alright you shouldnt worry that wa me at his age honestly i wouldnt worry about adhd with him because most extraverted child appear to have it however if he still continues like this stjs limit creativity and sfjs are way too febent and smothering so the whole antisj thing ha been established but if there wa one perfect type for u it would be entp surprising not w chickeneggplant parmesan peach crpes strawberry lemonade mac and cheese spaghetti and meatball thats the ti and fe working together yes all the time i agree with you i think the difference is that feeler arent coward and arent afraid to feel i think that under all of our layer of logic we thinker are probably even more sensitive well i have an extremely dominant alpha personality overall and i seldom meet anyone who can challenge me while my default is dom because of my tendency to push boundary ideally speaking id hi entp here okay so i can only speak for my screwed up self but yeah i am a romantic however im a closet romantic and honestly i can come across a borderline antilove and very whorey if you well i honestly dont like to mix physical affection with intellectual conversation but i love both by this i mean that i love cuddling in the dark with some food without saying much and i also this wa me back in high school guy who wa forced to sit next to me who i dont particularly like and isnt particularly attractive smile and say hi me awkwardly tuck strand of hair i cant only because it illegalimmoral i give up you win i need to follow the boss rule abstinence is bae bae well based on what you say about your mom i think she just doesnt think it funny when people get hurt which is actually very infp they take the pain of others very seriously and honestly we youre probably right about the insipid part you dont seem to fit into that category but i beg to differ when you say that it all generational it may be that way to a certain extent though my it is to be happy i used to be infpstyle depressed a a child but then i turned and realized that the meaning of life wa to be happy i never had another emo day ever again welcome to the club the single life rock finally fredom im an entp and my mom is an isfj she ha always based my ability in everything on my age ever since we both took iq test when i wa i got and she got so she like to pretend that i well maybe we all hate esfjs like your mom because they say that we dont deserve right im an entp and i have my infp mood and im telling you that both type should not be a particular goal for a typical esfj mostly because well get frustrated with you which will in turn upset i disagree completely i think it upside down well im definitely an nedom im not going to say otherwise im definitely wild crazy creative all over the place etc so yes i identify with ne very strongly however my ti is very well i make sure that im not a type because that is just an excuse to be a dumb as and it very obvious in term of trying to survive in society id obviously i want to be an sj instead because entp lol if only this correlation stuff wa true my mom is an isfj my grandpa is an isfp and my sister is an esfp i grew up with them and im an entp my dad is the closest thing to me intj but i only im an entp and my boyfriend is an infj and i can definitely see why we shouldnt mix there are stage in which you view each other differently and each one pose it own set of issue stage i usually never cry sometimes ive tried at funeral to prevent myself from laughing but it doesnt work like that however i bawl my eye out when someone finally get me to stop being an
