be working with others i would suggest accepting that youll be working with this person and instead concentrate more on dealing with the all the ingredient for an unhealthy relationship it all sound so romantic and familiar that explains how you go through idealising and devaluing others but i wa more interested in hearing about how you think the devaluing impact the other person the person suddenly being devalued actualized type istj who you are introverted i extroverted e sensing s intuitive n thinking t feeling f judging j perceiving p none of this make any sense to me if i knew someone had feeling for me and i didnt have feeling for them id probably start distancing myself from them mainly because i wouldnt want them to get hurt i dont needwant orangeappled these are my own observation based mostly on infps ive come across on this forum no it not scientific i wouldnt claim it is i have to point out though that your quote if that is the case then thats fine i dont mind being wrong i think it important to be open and honest so we can reach some level of self awareness behaviour that is dysfunctionaldamaging to the self should be identified and labeled a such what i have fair enough i suspected that wa what wa trying to be communicated i still think a lot of infps are rather childish in term of how they deal with difficult situation a well a how they handle im an istj my personal opinion based on a number of infps a well a isfps actually ive interacted withcome across on this forum yes many infps do come off a rather childish i dont know hey welcome i disagree based on first hand experience and it definitely not out of pridefear of rejection but i dont want to dwell on that i hope youll consider initiating conversation more with would be great then wed all stop wasting time on people who arent interested in making meaningful connection welcome again p would be interesting to hear about how you think your devaluationdiscard because that is what it is at the end of the day impact the other person i love this quote sometimes you hold back from talking to someone not because of your pride nor because you fear rejection but because you know deep down that if they wanted to be there in library whats that emoji just kidding though i havent been to an actual library since i wa about that would be year ago i have amazon kindle and audible so i have access to hello fellow istjs im looking for some book recommendation i dont know what im looking for exactly but something for my t im interested in self development and ive been going through nothing is going to change unless you change and this take some effort thats not to say youre not trying but you need to try harder and it all begin with changing the way you think whats the one thing that make you most happy in lifehappy to be alive feel free to detail how it make you feel and perhaps try to explain why you think that might be if you can also include the problem with that is it difficult to know whether the cause is some chemical imbalance or if im doing something wrong if it something im doing wrong then drug would just be hiding it for the past few day ive been on the verge of tear throughout the day and when im alone i just want to cry i honestly dont know why or whats triggered it being off work for a few day i feel like im having a life crisis i dont know what im doing and nothing make sense anymore life really isnt fun right now if i could magic it away a if i never existed and no one lakigigar thats very interesting thank you for sharing whats unhealthy about imagining your loved one being paralyzed or dead whats healthy about it what kind of emotion do you feel when you fantasise about such a thing do you like feeling sorry lakigigar your post strike me a being really really unhealthy i dont mean to judge ive had similar fantasy before im not sure too sure what the best thing to do in this scenario would be when im sadgrieving there is very little anyone else can do for me unless im very close to that person or theyre a a with all feeling loneliness is difficult to describe but ill try and give you my perspective on it firstly i relate to a lot of what youve said im not a very social person i keep moonious please see a doctor it not normal to have a headache for week the more i try to understand isfps and infps the more im convinced theyre just crazy crazy crazy crazy i feel crazy just thinking about how theyre crazy and now im experiencing semantic oh so thats what you meant yeah if i were you id drop him right now and not look back thats way overstepping boundary and it show he ha no respect for you whatsoever browneyedgirl i dont know im only going on what youve said he might have a completely different interpretation and perspective on this whole thing just a there are reason why you oo im sorry but this is pretty ridiculous i dont have anything else to contribute at this point good luck im confused what doe he want from you now exactly other than getting you to do stuff you no longer want to do kajada i listened to all of those band when i wa emoji some other band i remember from back then trapt the killer the used blink funeral for a friend i also liked he doe sound very immature i wonder what type he is anyway at least you know where you stand with him i hope youll stick to your value and not give in to his childish behaviour i dont seem to get excited about anything im not sure if it a personality type thing or if it something deeper doe anyone else feel this way and if so whats your type example i wa just kidding hehe regardless of that it doesnt give him the right to be a dick it doesnt sound a if he is even trying to save your relationshipunderstand where youre coming from and thats not a good sign i feel bad for you he sound like a dick but i think it clear that youre not compatible so i hope youll stop wasting your timeenergy on this ferroequinologist what do you mean by who you

wanted to hear all i am saying is no two relationship are alike and i alright i think at this point i have made myself clear i am going to stay with her i know myself and my situation best and i believe i have made the best decision i want to thank everyone for rawsugar i think i did set boundary not rule maybe i misspoke earlier but i told her what my boundary are personally i think it is inappropriate and dangerous for a man or a woman in a alright i get it well see a therapist well see one soon i dont want to see one right this moment however i am thinking in another few week ill feel more up to it i called my ryan thanks for the advice i am not going to break up with her however i do see your point that smothering her regulating her trying to keep tab on her etc may just push her farther this is going to be very hard indeed one of the biggest problem that i have with my girlfriend is communication she find it very hard to communicate with me around her i can talk to her a thank you everyone for your kind word she did tell me recently a few week back that she feel horrible about what shes done she wont do it again that she doe want to be with me and me i should add that i dont want to make my girlfriend out to be some monster for the first year of our relationship she wa sweet caring and supportive i wonder if living in my house i had a pan fried steak for lunch with a side of green bean oh yeah i broke out the a sauce too i must have the a when eating steak i am an istj but i might be an exception to the rule when it come to substance i have had issue with drug and alcohol in the past i suspect most istjs dont but then again most of my i am i know i am still young and trust me i want to wait at least another year before i have kid i guess i just fear not having that person around to have child with i dont know buying is better then renting in this economy especially in my area i have been saving all of my money up for year to buy a place i am in the real estate business and trust me it is cheaper thanks for the advice but maybe i should elaborate i live with a very toxic abusive narcassist my mother she is one of the most extreme case of narcissism you would ever imagine she call funny i always use head and shoulder no substitute unless it the generic version from cv or something i see no point in trying any other brand because head and shoulder ha always something also just occured to me today i have no problem cutting off contact with family member and friend who do abusive thing or betray my trust i do it quite easily it just when it i want to thank everyone for your insight advice and support i wish i could tell you guy i have made a decision but i am going to need some time to reflect and absorb all of this for a while what piss me off the most is idiot who wear their pant on their ground on the corner trying to talk to woman with statement like hey girl you look hella fine in them jean can i get your i agree i dont like the pot smoking but i tolerate it and asked her that she us it moderately however i smoked pot for year before i quit and i never did anything that stupid drinking we are very different people i am very introverted serious and desire to have peace and quiet she is more of a free spirit she like going to concert she listens to very heavy punk music well i probably should exlpain more about our relationship so all of you get a better understanding she ha suffered from depression problem a well partly because she came from a very abusive jenny thanks for your kind word and support my girlfriend told me about the affair one night she burst into tear and spilled the bean i guess the guilt wa too much i am surprised she hey everyone i found out week ago that my girlfriend of almost year cheated on me she had unprotected sex one time with another man and didnt tell me about it for about a month despite you belong in the gutter with the rest of the rat vermin over here in san francisco you sound like a deranged liberal who off your med have you sold all your medication again and wont get wow what insight you have my whole entire day is ruined now whether or not i used kind language most liberal would still would have written me off after my first post the way a liberal the autistic spectrum wa made up long after autism came about autism ha become a trend among mental health professional you must remember mental health diagnosis by the psychiatry industry i tip around when i am getting food delivered when i am going out to eat i tip although i am an istj i thought id post anyways i am a recovered alcoholic so when i drink now and day i set a limit at beer and make sure i never go over that and get drunk yes i think you need to see your psychiatrist and ask him to lower your dose of prozac the reason we have such high cost of health care in america is because of regulation government so much for the whole idea that liberal are tolerant of other people your comment show exactly how intolerant and hateful liberal are you sound just like the caller in this video i wanted to start a thread about people favorite place in america i am a huge geography buff especially california geography in my free time i travel all over california trying to discover thanks great one finally someone who actually ha a brain in this thread too many people in this forum spout off everything they heard on the daily show or from their commie professor and did you even watch the video it wa smuggled to the u by a cuban doctor who had nothing to do with fox news fox news just reported on the footage this guy brought back regardless of whether or i am a huge dog and animal lover i have a dog named midnight who just turned yesterday my girlfriend and i bought her a doggy cake and put candle on top and sang her happy birthday there first of all truly autistic people have severe mental and physical handicap this is really a troubling comparison that the original poster ha made i blame the psychiatric industry mostly i am sorry that you are going through this friendship can be difficult to mantain especially in a time where grad school marriage and other type of life change are happening among people an appropriate response by a marxist who just lost the argument you lost when you pulled out the wikipedia reference tongue listen if youre going to pull quote from wikipedia it not worth having a conversation with you your obviously a socialist and you are obsessed with the government running every part of your i hold grudge because it let others know that what they have done is so unnaceptabe that i have to stop all contact with them being a recluse myself and only wanting a close circle of family why do almost all other country member of government come to america for treatment when they or their loved one get a serious illness if there own medical system wa so great why do they i stay stick with it im sure you will have to take class in different area of psychology ie abnormal developmental child etc maybe you will fall in love with one particular area or wow thank you so much for speaking up i am a white man and i have been in a relationship with a black woman for year she is the love of my life and she ha experienced a backlash like you ive alredy began posting but i noticed there wa a section of the forum that allowed you to post an intro so im here to introduce myself im andrew and i am year old in day a i am guessing you must be a fan of rand and ron paul then i like them both but i tend to like and agree with rand paul more because he is a bit more of a conservative then his father who is

ENTJ.'",it pretty wellestablished that thinking type are more common among men and feeling type are more common among woman but what is the most common feeling type among men and the most common ive never met anybody that i think wa an enfj infj or entj i may have met an esfj and isfp but im not sure atheist istj my estp father is about the most militant atheist ive ever seen his issue is with the logical hole in religion the way that others use it to manipulate people and the way that it define well unfortunately yes s actually i think that the thread went quite well the wheel fell off pretty quickly but ive learned a lot more about entps from that than from the it worth learning especially the intertype relation the basic idea is that all the type have access to all eight function but they only really want to use four of them i love interacting with ne type especially nfps two of my best friend in high school were enfps my infp sister and i used to fight terribly but around the time she turned we suddenly i cant stand it when an istj want to share every single piece of knowledge that they think is relevant to the conversation or when they try to show off how smart and knowledgeable they are only to perhaps example would help clarify my intent in asking a relative insists on bringing several friend who you do not know to your birthday party which will otherwise be attended a an istj i sometimes have difficulty understanding how entps think im particularly interested in how they handle moral decision if you dont put stock in socionics or function you can if it a stupid procedure i dont really care about it either if im going by the book it because a whats in the book work or b i dont yet know what im doing and im relying on the book some people think that sensor are somehow inferior and sjs siusers in particular this is because si ha a reputation a boring obstinate unchanging and uncreative sidoms isjs are seen im terrible at consoling people knowing when to shut up the math part of physic i can understand a lot of the concept just not the math not procrastinating when i strike up a conversation with a stranger at the bus stop and befriend them systematic even in my fantasy i am systematic i tend to reuse the same paradigm of action and organisation repeatedly knowing which one is appropriate for the given situation which is judging by your avatar perhaps istp by your posting history perhaps intp the most romantic thing somebody can do is give me a hug im a very touchyfeely person though you wouldnt think it the worst thing you can do is give me empty platitude i hate fake romantic ij nidoms can deny fact while trying to make everything fit into their model of reality hitler infj especially towards the end of the war and stalin intj especially in the period leading ive known a few entps theyre generally fun to be around i enjoy their sense of humour and the aura of energy that seems to constantly roll off of them however occasionally they can surprise me nb if you arent completely solid on function theory or dont know what it is read this it not the most accurate explanation of what function are and it veers into nonstandard terminology take a look at my bookshelf on goodreads lot of history book on linguistics and anthropology but also a ton of fantasy scifi and other novel notably there arent too many classic i i can cook pretty well and im rather good at improvising i tend to use lot of spice and try to find interesting combination my favourite thing to make is omelette i enjoy cooking eating istj here nb i rely pretty heavily on function theory here i absolutely disagree sensing is a pretty unfortunate misnomer because it make one think of the five sens and a focus on the the whole focus on tradition and rule with sidoms is somewhat misplaced when it come to rule and tradition ie existing system the reasoning is this system isnt here for no reason my ideal tend towards the liberal end of the spectrum but my method tend towards the conservative end and by conservative i mean original flavour conservative before the term got hijacked by the best thing you can do is be yourself we are extremely good at telling when somebody is being fake and we hate it just be yourself if he not interested in you then youre wasting your time if he sending mixed signal it because he trying to work up the courage to do something about how he feel ask him about his feeling for you but do not be confrontational about it for i like how you excluded isfjs introverted sensing is just so boring isnt it sarcasm actually though i think that infs are no more capable ability is independent of type theyre read this skip to the howto section if youre in a hurry although id strongly recommend reading the whole thing if the drug can be reproduced then i dont waste it on him i take it to a laboratory to be analysed for mass production but assuming that it cant be reproduced it not my place to decide i very strongly disagree that portrait capture only surface behaviour and not the underlying thought process behind it and it also contains a good deal of incorrect information for this post im going to assume you know about function if you dont read this this is the socionics description of the sliistp socionics sliistp mbti istj importantly it includes trying to type yourself using the dichotomy ie n ft jp can be very difficult i would suggest learning about cognitive function this site explains what function are and how they work highlevel feusers fjs because fe considers action in term of how they affect other people and what other people will think feusers are thus very concerned with what other people think and i dont daydream a lot usually in idle moment im just thinking about upcoming event in order of how soon they are soonest first or not thinking about anything just watching my surroundings enfp same function reversed order meaning that we share the same value and that they are strong where we are weak and weak where we are strong so we can reinforce each other im a teacher i find passive aggressive behaviour difficult to sustain i dislike it when others use it to try to send a message id rather have them tell me whats wrong straight to my face so i can fix it my mother is an istj we think exactly alike and disagreement stem mainly from difference in opinion or experience and not from personality the thing about istjs is that we are absolutely terrible at gauging how other people feel so even if we think somebody like u we do nothing because thats the safest course of action and were those description are not that detailed this description of the istjsliistp and this description of the istplsiistj are longer meatier and more detailed it easy to mistake a type for where did you get the function stack sitenise thats not possible in mbti or socionics socionics function and mbti dominant auxiliary tertiary and inferior respectively this i dont much relate to the bit about physical state but if you edited the si paragraph a bit removing the word physical then yes i absolutely relate to it i am very aware of what stimulus istj here image i like it it reminds me of structure and of fall which is a time of year i like it make me think of slow but steady growth image this is my favourite it a complex it doe to an extent it not perfect but it far

are time that i wa on the edge of no longer my two cent is that the biggest thing you can get from mbti and cognitive information is understanding how you are now and how others are the more significant can actually be understanding im not sure we would be the best on telling you how to strengthen it from what little ive read and understand on it your dominate is usually something that your naturally strong with i dont i learn best when i have someone thats a good teacher i will then usually read the material i tried the other way around and i find that i get very bored if ive seen some of the material welcome to the forum ive found that some people are border line in one or more of the area i think you might get the most out of you might be a istjintjx if thread each one pretty some sj profile tend to emphasize traditional way would you consider yourself traditional are there any tradition you find stupid this is a mixture for me some thing i really like i think the humour from an istj is an acquired taste it in the moment for me i dont do standup or anything people usually end up laughing at thing i say though ive put people in tear lol so no notepook writing down time and location jk so better to attempt a second meeting before asking for a number probably gauging how intersted she might seem thanks for the response i didnt have anyone specifically in mind i wa just wanting to see if any place wa better then others like if it a total waste of time if i see someone in a grocery welcome to the cafe so are you from france or just being fancy welcome i think you will enjoy this a lot i have a friend thats an entp and he love the forum here welcome to the forum hope you enjoy your stay i love old school metallica aerosmith enya and mostly the s i wa curious what public venue you would be comfortable with a guy striking up a conversation such a book store coffee shop grocery store etc along with that whats the most comfortable i wa curious what some of the other istjs do a a hobby nod head what do you mean how doe it feel i understand your word but not the order your using them in those m f changed the packagingname andor stopped making my definetly a lot more talkative one on one the topic is the most important thing i have a friend that is an entp and the topic brought up are thing that i dont have much interest in a lot of welcome to the board im sure you will find some great conversation more privatized how doe that work exactly initially they were all country run drs and hospital and now some private one welcome to the forum you will find it most intersting infps are somewhat rare i know a few personally though ive recommended it to one of them to find other infps i think you might find im just curious what health care is like in non u country ive read and seen thing on tv and documentary i would like to hear first hand story from people around the world specifically welcome to the board how do you like living in canda it depends on how the breakup went the specific are very important to me if they were just not happy with the dating situation i might need a little time away but then i would probably still cautious mgsrvr cautious calculating contemplative and careful this person like for thing to make sense and to understand the reason d definetly agree with you on all point i dont think this one will get to heated because we are istjs after all lol it part of the reason i wanted to ask istjs i will probably start a the possibility of being pawn is one of the biggest reason we dont have a leader or a check list it also why we dont want to be for one canidate or one political affiliation our well put yes generalization are bad i used to have a lot of negative feeling towards the tea party like most of america i wa ill informed and forming opinion with little or no data we a little bit of both really partially to add something to thread also i wa curious on a suggestion to me that s are the reason that thing are the way they are that s desire thing to be no favorite word here kind of a wierd concept to me lol thats like having a favorite blade of grass i can say that disorganized can be applied at time a leaderless group will be somewhat disorganized i would disagree everyone in it is anarchist although there are some in the overall group wow he definitely ha a lot of dislike of it i dont know how much i want to post here but iwould like to give my thought on this gentleman statement on it frank ha definitelynever spent any i appolgize im not that experienced with using forum ill try to keep that in mind for future post thanks for that it something ive been in discussion with a friend over i think im a lot more open to discussing thing then i wa ten year ago i do not enjoy super in depth discussion a if it okay to ask infjs reading this post for both my curiousity and the starter of the post have any infjs reading this thread dated an istj married an istj your thought and feeling on i a an istj am no so direct with my emotion personally i think that the fact that he is communicating with you more is a good sign the more i intitiate contact with a woman the more im what are you thought and opinion about it if you dont mind discussing lol yes it is an awesome pic so i wa curious if any other istj have done any research or discussion with anyone that is part of the occupy movement if so thought the guy that are saving themselves are usually going to be the one that dont stand out in crowd or group they arent going to be the one that have girl going out with them every friday i wa somewhat interseted until they started asking for anyone that spends more then a second about donating money i worry about to many people that take advantage of donators lol this is awesome wow totally forgot about that one especially something i really like creme brulee mmm cooky good stuff im horrible with cooking so something home cooked is great i usually stay at home a bit

understand that it might be annoying to have them on your they arent sure of when it started but i wa in depression at the age of and lasted to around what happened is that i wa doing alot of sport and had alot of pressure on me too much in i have had long term crush because i never had the gut to go and ask them xd and i still cant im too shy and afraid of rejection i find essential having basic cooking knowledge ex i had class when i wa younger and my parent always required that i help cooking or get a cookbook from your mom internet i think is essential is it possible to be both money is simply money it buy stuff and you get it from working or gift so static is like i do thing sometimes but not anything too extreme and dynamic is i speak and tell her all the time and show her i love her if that the case then im static fun i would send a subtle message a in i dont like you anymore maybe play a mean trick on them eventually it would go away i guess but i will always have a little something for the person i i have to agree with zeth thinking doe not make you cool only make you realise everyone else around you doesnt think xd you are a logicalmathematical thinkerlogicalmathematical thinkerslike to understand pattern and relationship between object or actionstry to understand the world in term of cause and effect i think drug should be taken only if needed and when took under the supervision of a psychiatrist taking drug to escape reality or for fun is simply retarded drug since it just not good for your i think a stubborn istj can achieve anything it want because when a stubborn istj really want something they become machine of work and success toward what they want actually im kinda cheating i have adhd so intrusive thinking is controlled by my medication xd wake if hello ever tell you something like i love you i suggest you run real fast because she probably gon na be really angry i like isfj they come to the istj forum wich make them cool person d if i had to summarize limerence i would do it like that lack of confidence doubt limerence that why rejection remove someone from a limerent state because if you do lack of confidence i voted because im the most stubborn guy i ever knew i changed what wa suppose to be a min meeting into a hour min raging debate wich of course i ended up winning and arguing rock i would love if you could provide me link to these study you are talking about and doctoring is wide a doctor could encourage you to eat better and do sport but he couldnt teach you to eat that so true but we are nice when we are in couple i mean we are the best in couple just wait for them to divorce and support her in her divorce oh wow limerence make a while i didnt look at this subject i think istj could look they are like limerent toward the person they like but the obsessive part of limerence is really big and i dont i thought most of istj learned better trought visual maybe you should try that i hate beign the leader but somehow it always end up on me leading and when im not leader the one leading always make decision on what i think is good or they trust me for important job so i dont maybe but if you cant take the right decision for that kid because you are emotionally implied and empathy and emotion are not necessarily needed that just an idiot moral principle of not i think you are istj but i might be wrong p try thus spake zarathoustra from nietzche go take a look at kant and freud too d actually i think of the reason istj go so well with isfj is simple like petal said earlier istj keep their emotion bottled up to function correctly and the isfj kinda take care of that emotional dont want to be negative but istj enfp rarely working out note too much text i think about horse obviously next time i wil explait it like that so even if you do the result is still xd that make no sense because to not think about something you have to think about not thinking on it wich mean everytime you are ignoring it you are thinking about it i have the answer ber no seriously i dont think i need to be more outgoing because party are not that fun anyway xd but anyway it great if you see u a person who do more for other but i dont think we are special but i dont think you are selfish even if you dont give money to the homeless because this money is i think selfishness should be spoken of carefully why because people are selfish even without realising it wich mean when you say other people are selfish you are yourself being selfish ex if maybe what you consider nice we see it a normal or forced ex if of my friend have problem for any reason and i try to help him then i dont consider it nice i think it wa my duty because he hypocrite and unfair people or of the planet and people who say they have value and are moral yes shes the i liked and i like number it is really a love killer number too xd i made a huge plan telling group a i loved someone group b someone else and i told group c i loved them she wa in group c the day after that i pretended it wa a joke and that i wa toying with them im an atheist because for me there no solid proof god could exist and for politics nothing really i live in canada quebec and i think we have the worst politician ever so i vote for the rhino party well since the girl i liked told me we are only friend i became le and le in love with her that the only way i know sela how can you have trouble putting a coat if you want i can make a tuto it rather easy xd nah seriously i think politeness and the way the

todat it a blue polo yay you forgot that enfp have to get along with istj too army istj at the age of i killed that spirit it never came back never i am over analysing too might be due to the fact i

worked on here for you both firstly i personally hold to it that if i promise someone i will do something i will all but agree with a lot of this though want to add an aside for me i have discovered that alone time doesnt have to be physically alone i personally need what would more accurately be called dont a an istj i can confirm this if you tell me time a day you love me thats nice but if thats all you do ill stop believing you in like two or three day but if you bring me a lunch after varies by person regardless of type if he ha never talked about it you should assume he doesnt need it much he doe but youre naturally perceptive of it and therefore do not annoy dating enfp for month didnt read many post here my take they like all others vary individually some are wishywashy flaky and fail to follow through this isnt true of all enfps even if if i had to wager a guess youre dealing with an istj who doesnt really have any game but want to get to the point where they flirt with you i dont know i dont personally touch anyones my enfp girlfriend say im one of the sweetest most understanding people shes ever met and that i get her like no one ever ha she refers to her past relationship a relationship and ha great post the last main paragraph resonate so much with me that im having to fight the urge to send them to my girlfriend not that she isnt great at recognizing those thing already but plenty of people would describe me a peppy outgoing energetic and intense that doe come out around the right people in the right situation etc and usually it will drain me in the end probably just him this doe sound like esfj tendency but exclusively in the case of unhealthy one healthy welladjusted esfjs would absolutely not guilt manipulate you to obtain praise and would me and infps tend to miscommunicate seems to stem from the infp trying to read into what i say when what im saying is almost always a reflection of what i mean and nothing more or le in the case of the enfp female i had of also take cognitive function test at the time i wa discussing this with my theninterest nowgirlfriend i wa very surprised she tested a an enfp polystyrene man gave a great answer that would very closely match the one i wa coming here to post person with few friend reporting in to confirm a well a deny most of my close friend are enfpesfj i am leaving out a few here and there to be fair my isfp roommate entp dad etc dating enfp for month now official for a bit over month it been really fantastic of course it still early on and all but shes really wonderful shes doing a study abroad in australia not particularly i take a lot of thing seriously where i feel like many others would genuinely not be bothered but at the same time i dont really get into fight in relationship i never this kind of thing is correct i dont consider myself in love right now ive only been dating this current girl for a few month but im totally enamored and though ive been working on i can be a pessimist too but i dont imagine shes the sort of person for it shes the one pushing for u to make it official before she leaf so she doesnt lose me i wa the one i will be monitoring this thread started a thing with an enfp a few month ago and shes wonderful this post is just a thanks to those who have posted and to keep them coming im sure it qft in response to ops request for enfp opinion i have a good friend who is enfp and she ha said very similar thing if you asked her right now to describe me in word id put money on if i had to guess si and fi keep secret best and fe and se keep secret worst you are no longer attracted and wish to break up some version of i dont think this is right for me anymore i wish i could control the way i feel but it just hasnt been working in my head agreed with infx and probably type or id say sensitivity and a cryprone reaction to stimulus are thing that a i understand are not at all common among u istj folk i also react to i take it more seriously than i should right now partly because my last relationship partner of year had while we were dating broken a promise she made me and it damaged my ability to trust i dated an intp girl in high school i thought she wa very fascinating but it wa certainly my most volatile relationship yet so the advice id give each party istj dont try to pick her just so well said but op i will still bite by offering myself a context complex compared to others id say everyone is indeed complex but if there were a spectrum i do think id be towards just experienced a situation that reminded me of seeing this thread here i am to offer two penny i do not expect potential mate to read my mind that is completely unreasonable i am annoyed pen and print only use pencil for scantron exam and sometimes graph only use cursive for my name or a ta name when im trying to be fancy solid of the time pen and print i dont get how liking foot ha anything to do with any of what you said it threw off my ability to follow the rest of your post i pee on most of my belonging if thats what youre asking are you prone to having a spiritual faith no how do you react when you see an injustice depends on the extent calmly and quickly react or just fume with silent resentment when a i believe intp would require much le effort to light on fire combatable heh im actually not sure whether youre wondering if theyre compatible or combative doe it affect anything contextually if i mention that im so in basically every situation there actually wa growing and maturation for u both to undergo i never really

more often than i my eye creep me outtheyre ice blue and make me look like i have no soul i keep constant eye contact with people and im sure it freak them out too truth is i have absolutely nothing to good lordjust say hey you wan na go grab a beer eat some sushi steal cop car etc sometime if he say alright ask for his phone number so you can coordinate a timeplace because yall youtube seems my infj doe the catch and release thing a lot with me well fire emailstext message back and forth time a day for a weeknothing crude just banter and sometimes deep youtube if he a runner then good luck to you keeping up wink i swear running like an aphrodisiac or something one of the first basslines i learned ian ha amazing vox youtube i like marathonson the road and in the bed im about on being intimate and just having a good screwingbut theyre not exclusive either it usually very clear when im stressed and youtube i like trying new stuff if it one on one or with people that are close to me i fell in love with surfing like this skydiving is another example but you wont see me try something ridiculous did you ever fear irrational thing like a shark in the swimming pool because i totally

military is sort of an avenue to meet people butwhat im expected to do is sort of in conflict with how i would build a relationship also there all kind of rule about who i can talk thats exactly it thats good advicei can actually do this well but it requires a lot of work on my part trying to get through the check to see if there some way i can connect with well yeai understand the relationship thread is draining maybe ive been guarded for so long that it a very natural thing that i dont realize either im giving off a serious back the school work church any type of social gatheringdo most istjs get a sense of being there but not really seems ive never really had an inner circle some people know me better than others youtube thats it character strength judgment thinking thing through and examining them from all side are important aspect of who you are you do not jump to conclusion and you rely only on solid this make a lot of sense i do this all the time for instance if im hanging out with someone and they suddenly say they have to leavei might worry that i said something wrong yeakyrie is definitely an earworm so shadow function basically mean everything is reversed so instead of thinking like an istj i would identify more with an enfp an entj would be like an isfp up the iron youtube spidermoon make senseim sort of on n and often test intj a well maybe that ha something to do with it and yes im under a great deal of stress most of this ha to do with this one inspires me the same way my infj friend doe infjs youtube doe a mother ever stop loving her son in a romantic sense it can last forever if two people are bonded or connected in a way that allows it most love likely fade or transition to is it typical for an istj to over analyzing thing people say or what they do for instance if someone say theyre going to do something at a particular time because of xxxwould your mind run oh mani hate that icon i actually dread checking voice mail because it usually a bunch of people talking that irritate the shit out of me whats worse is that when you hit clear it the do you think before you open your mouth

of those unscratchable mental itch nothing it pretty much just a normal day for me maybe at the very most id like to have a nice dinner with a so but other than that i dont really want any kind of celebration and even when i if he can change at all it going to take a very long time i think he originally said year on his own for really good reason you will not be able to rush him to mature and some aspect of omg yes that ft inconsistency absolutely kill me you said it in much more detail but yeah all of that that you said lol if it wasnt a breakup id actually appreciate such detail but since it is i agree it probably too much especially if the istj is in love with you it doe seem strange that a bunch of people have been banned all at once i have literally only felt real effortlessas in i wasnt specifically trying to understand or specifically trying to relate or empathize empathy probably twice in my life once wa the you spend several hour maybe even spread over multiple day tagging all of your music adding album cover fixing genre listing improperly named tag etc if he like me he might be running away because he literally cant process anything anymore and just need to shut off to regain energy to even be able to think or talk i get angry when weekend thanks for real i think i knew that but ive been resisting because in some way even though im afraid of mediocrity another part is afraid of becoming something more which is what i mean there some other people i talk to outside of this close circle that i definitely have deep talk with but it like to me their problem are still their problem not mine so while how do i even do this i mean im living with what i would consider to be very supportive people even by most people standard at least i think so again i think i have this already but this is something ive definitely had an issue with for a long time now too not really sure how to deal with it either im year late to my own thread sorry i think i just panicked and needed to say something and it kind of happening again i forgot i even made this thread see i feel like i am very no japanese can be spoken genderless unless you specifically point it out i mostly watch anime read manga play gamesspecifically character action game like dmc mgr bayonetta etc i havent done it since i wa a kid but ive always liked mountain biking and camping personally i kind of hate that i am an istj living with an entp i see the power of ne ti and with infj the power of ni fe and i just hate how selfish it make me feel i dont have selfdiscipline i have an infp friend she ha been pretty strongly affected by her life experience so she get angry or upset somewhat easily and often with mei think i want to be her friend and i know she

boston went to military when im talking about pain im referring to physical pain and not emotional pain on others intentional a a career choice ie doctor dentist surgeon veterinarian soldier police it the state capitol of texas im sure youve heard of texas nice town hot a hades in the summer though atlanta washington dc austin denver la vega i have no idea how it came up with atl i dont like atl at all not the weather the traffic or the culture dc is is too i dont have cable so i end up watching thing on netflix long after the season is over dexter doctor who lost though the last few season werent very good i just kept watching to see what would you ever consider going bungee jumpingskydiving for recreational purpose heck no in the army i had to do some of this sort of thing rappelling it wa my job so i did it quotehellothats interesting never tried this i meant that we usually ended up going to the mall which is what teenage girl with nothing to do and no car frequently did in the why do you always look so mad are you mad asked by your friend who not that close to you huh what do i look mad i wa thinking that must be my thinking face let hang out hm some of it sound like your subconscious throwing up occasional emotional grenade at you some of it might be hormonal im definitely gloomier and more easily annoyed at that time of the i think my mother iswas an infp shes had a serious mental illness since i wa so it hard to say for sure so when i talk about her personality im talking about how she wa preillness i make decision very fast often too fast in hindsight i guess it my strong j preference but i cant stand openendedness i gather a much relevant data a i can within a fairly brief my weird thing when embarking on a new relationship is that i automatically memorize every conversation verbatim if the object of my desire mention some slight detail about his greataunt tilly these title mean le a you get older but i think it safe to say im a nerd with slight geekish tendancies i always liked doctor who and the star trek series but im not obsessed with i can be interested in almost anything in the shortterm but if i think the subject is silly astrology or too trivial what happened last night on american idol or whatever ill tune out maybe the random cupcake are an enfp thing you know kind of the opposite of what we would do i suppose youre right stillan istj getting kicked out of the military it hard to imagine we normally fit right into the big machine like we were custommade for it you seem like an istj with a very balanced ft a kinder gentler istj i voted for you a an isfj at firstbut upon reflection i would probably make that istj i havent noticed anything nicely put if whatevers said isnt near the mark ill just shrug it off and think geez what a jerk and go about my day if i think there some truth in it thoughoh that just eats me he is probably not deliberately trying to hurt you he doesnt know what he want which isnt that strange in a year old whose life is suddenly in a state of flux he may be trying to grab im and this sound pretty much exactly not like me so i dont think age is the determining factor i only have so much giveadamn to go around and a lot of thing just dont make the cut so i agree the enneagram is kind of a pain in the butt compared to mbti my score were crazy the first time i took it even i think really all over the place totally unlike the mbti evil ha meant a lot of different thing at different time and place in history let look at some thing we consider abhorrent but which were perfectly normal good and accepted in other time thanks i think that carrie fisher quote is brilliant i dont mean randomly predictive i mean i had dream where i wa in a room with a certain group of people and someone said or did i went back and read this whole thread just now after i posted what a great discussion kudos for talking about something like this both sensibly and sensitively thats extremely rare on the im not sure the op meant just physical abuse though in any case some woman will take advantage of the never hit a woman law ingrained in most men head and will use physical violence for much of the time i wa in college the first time i acted very different from the way i had before or the way i have since i wa extremely needy of other people i hated being alone i wa i dont believe in the supernatural however im open to the idea that there are natural phenomenon we dont understand yet and those could encompass thing that other people call supernatural im not naturally talented at reading body language ive had to teach myself a ive gotten older i dont think it something with which a lot of istjs are gifted though maybe it just me depends on the type of risk for me ill do some thing most people would consider risky if ive planned for them in advance ive traveled by myself across most of europe and a lot of the u for nope i make enough small talk to be pleasant and polite but i dont feel the need to go any deeper with of the population if i am genuinely interested in someone or something ill make the im now and i wa probably about when i took my first online mbti test ive always tested a an istj though i only started getting more interested in it and how istjs relate to other type i vaguely remember letting some other kid copy my latin homework i never cheated on a test i did however steal candy from a local grocery store on a few occasion when i wa ish so i ive always felt like an outsider except for a brief period when i wa in college not sure why that wa different unless it wa because i wa shadowme an enfp i can feel like i belong with i can count the number of sick day ive taken in the last year on two finger and i had perfect attendance every quarter when i went back to school for another degree a couple of year ago i agree with the others that istjs have a deep obsessive streak i get deeply into the minutia of thing that pique my interest once i feel like ive learned everything i can about something sound pretty normal for an older istj to me we really like our time at home it our haven from the world i think that quote a man home is his castle wa probably coined for an istj do you carve out time for you to take care of you emotionally and physically yes a an introvert who ha the luxury or misfortune depending on your perspective of living alone i have indeed but ive never seen anything like this on a mbti website psychological type profile pure mumbojumbo edited to add when i call it mumbojumbo im referring to the physical i read an article recently talking about the root of gossip in evolutionary psychology how it would have been a useful survival strategy when we lived in small group to know who wa sleeping with for those who dont know the socionics type are slightly different from the mbti type so using your mbti type there might be misleading i personally find socionics to be about a believable im in the keep your head down and do your job camp and a my work persona is hard working polite and innocuous vanilla even i dont inspire strong feeling in most people one way or i started drinking coffee when i wa twelve i freely admit i am addicted to it ive had to give it up before no caffeine allowed in military basic training it wa a long long eight week i fantasize plenty i have no problem making up story plot conversation alternative history etc what ive never been able to do and what it sound like your istj couldnt do either

basketballfootballbaseballtrack meet that i played in growing up especially if a great play happened in it all of my friend knew this it might be typical for the fact that he cant go on living knowing someone doesnt like him and he want to make it better but it definitely not normal to stay hang out friend a soon a one growing up in an educated christian home my three brother and i had pretty close to the same view on premarital sex the intp infp and istj are still virgin or are married but our little esfp definitely not a group date he wont ever talk except for a random fact he find interesting

same thing or better described a high infatuation during a short period there ha been at if my name is being printed for professional use i use kenneth i introduce myself a ken and newspaper article usually shorten it to ken naturally i do not go by kenny at all anymore except i like the fountainhead better mainly because i relate more to roark than any of the atlas character even though i am

date when the date came up she said she had back tiff miller how do you know he an istj it almost seems like a lot of guy are getting clumped into my group if he is an istj then all i can say is that

their business watching u deal with problem i dont run from confrontation but at the same time i dont actively seek it out i dislike dealing with confrontation but if i feel that it is my duty to handle the situation i take care of it thanks for all the reply i consider myself to be pretty private person but i start to open up after a few week of getting to know someone which is why i thought i would ask you guy if you had how private are you guy and how long doe it take you to warm up to others there is a girl i work with who im pretty sure is an infp and she almost seems to go out of her

if someone want me to know that they like me then theyll need to spell it out and say it bluntlyotherwise i just wont know so yes im definitely socially im the exact same way adverse to using social networking sitesmessengers which basically mean if the person isnt physically nearby then there a good chance well lose contact unsure welcome to personalitycafe laughing yay i look forward to finding out proud finding out how well different type interact with each other always intrigue me istj here wave laughing sugarfix out of curiosity do you know what type your husband is or if he would take the test happyjust curious i understand and appreciate your suggestion but i just dont think thats likely to happen im all for saying hey i like spending time with you we should do it more often in fact i plan to say oooh that make more sense so why are you in the esfp group or at least thats what it say under your username the only problem isi dont really talk about my feelingsever like not even with my parent or people im really close friend with im not sure why it so difficult for me but it another female istj yay proud welcome to personalitycafe sugarfix offtopic sorry but are you sure that youre an esfp mellow i ask mostly because this doesnt sound very esfp to me yes this is exactly my problem usually when i befriend extrovert theyll make it obvious that they like me and want to be my friend then well do something together that same daynightweekend happy response good sign yay at least i know i can still interpret the obvious when it come to emotion hehe proud i suppose thats true about the invitation since a a fellow shy the last new movie i watched slumdog millionaire the last actual movie i watched before sunrise happy thanks for responding i hope youre right mellow i just called him and said that i would go and he sounded really happy and kind of surprised when i told himso thats a good sign yeshappy well i talked to him this morning during and after class but i forgot to ask him about the party however he did kind of invite me to go with him to a lecturediscussion on international foreign i guess i just assumed it would be a big party with lot of friend and loud music otherwise why would he mention the part about his roommate being out of town for the weekend would he really have after thinking about it more ive finally come to the conclusion that he really doesnt feel strongly toward me either way he probably feel something like if we become good friend fine if maybebut considering the party is with his friend im sure he comfortable with them tongue or maybe not haha thanks for the input though actually i grew up an army brat and so ive known a lot of military people some older some peer and some in different area of the military marine airforce navy etc and about of thats okay all advice is appreciated laughing i feel the same way even when i have gone to party in the past with close friend i still dont have very much fun id rather just be at thanks im relieved to know that im not the only person who feel that way about party a for the excusedo i need one can i just tell him that the party scene really isnt for me and yeah im definitely taking all the advice with a grain of salt the other day i seemed more confident about him wanting to be friend but honestly im still unsure today the isfj guy finally thanks for your input yeah i definitely think im going to have to just suck up my shyness and go ahead and take the initiative i would hate to lose something that could turn into a good i understand this i could feel that there is a connection between u and the potential for a good friendship but he may not feel the same way i definitely accept that thanks for your opinion oh i understand now thanks thats true i hadnt thought about it like that before thats a good point i do think that it would bother me if i wa the one who constantly had to take the i just first wanted to say thank you for giving me your perspective im an introvert so i didnt think itd be that hard to figure out a introverted malebut it definitely is a lot more difficult haha is it the office supply store used to be my favorite place a a kid then when i wa i worked there for the summer in the interview i told them how much i used to but still love it haha i thought so but all the type have flaw like with meif someone expects me to hug them and go into detail about my love and feeling for them on a daily basis then theyll be sorely i think the bolded part is the problem with some of the intjs ive known they can seriously hold a grudge then they end up remaining isolated from that person with time they dont deal with haha yeahnot many of u around unfortunately bored i do this all the time everything else i dont really do except for the momflowers thing one time proud this would annoy me not make me feel the love tongue and if a person did im the same a long a im prepared for the question i can speak confidently and without hesitation but if they ask me something i didnt prepare for then ill definitely have to pause for a haha so true tongue welcome to the forum naydra hmmwhen i wa a kid i wanted to be a lawyer i also loved office supply so i definitely wanted to have a nice office of some kind wink the exact same thing happened with me i took this history course once and barely ever spoke in class then we each had to give this big presentation in a lecture hall filled with about wowyeah id have to agree with this i absolutely loved being friend with an intj the intellectual conversation wa very stimulating and enjoyable but they hold a grudge like no other and a

random curveballs pen and cursive i use pencil for math but nothing more in my opinion pen are easier and smoother to write with i used to be a big fan of print because i thought cursive wa too fancy for no i read a lot can be almost anything though i have a particular interest in investing much of my reading in the future will pertain to company financial statement other than that video game my girlfriend is an esfp weve been together for over a year and a half now with plan to marry once i graduate from college sometimes we get on each others nerve a bit and occasionally we ive been watching a lot of the big bang theory lately and i must admit that im more like sheldon than i wish im not a genius above average intelligence but certainly not offthecharts and hi all im new to the istj forum i used to frequent the intj forum at least for reading the other day it occurred to me that i hadnt been on personality cafe in forever in my time away my mbti i thoroughly dislike tea ive tried it at least twice before just dont care for it i do think society is going downhill in numerous way not the least of which is the american fascination ive been a christian for year i knew it because i trusted her more than anyone i had known before by far she wa also the only girl maybe person ive ever met who i could be comfortable with sitting with but doing different i think im decent looking i would never say that i have moviestar good look my girlfriend think im really cute though and her opinion is really the only one that matter to me so im happy i know that most type find blunt answer repelling but for an intj thats usually the best way to do it and if an intj asks you for advice and he not being sarcastic youre probably in ive only had one girlfriend the one im currently with and i havent cheated on her so nope im so bad at flirting that i dont think i could ever hope to get the chance to cheat on her even if yes it possible to have platonic friend of the opposite sex there are certain conversation topic you should stay away from but it really not that hard to do that at least not for u i dont really tell people what my mbti is because the few people ive told have mostly told me in response that no one care why try to tell someone about something they dont care about in most hm didnt know that thanks for sharing what the hell is she saying you can be a shy extrovert ive never met a shy extrovert or outgoing introvert for someone who ha supposedly studied andor spent a lot of time thinking about you see perc asking if you want to meet up with other member and you disdainfully say uh no then you see link to the type forum inviting you to chat with them and you say with a confused having an intj personality is absolutely not the same thing a having aspergers not by a long shot i may have some form of autism but it is not related to my personality type in any way try having a deep meaningful conversation about something be prepared for the chance that you will have to lead the conversation a the intj will probably not open up you fast enough to do much of i wa insecure about my girlfriend at first but luckily for me she kept assuring me that she wanted to be with me until i finally learned beyond a shadow of a doubt that she did in fact love me i have a voracious sexual appetite my girlfriend and i do it constantly when she is in town i have never sent a picture of my junk to anyone not even my girlfriend and i dont intend to it can full beard and mustache i had to be clean shaven in high school due to dress code requirement but my facial hair grew really fast so i often had to shave time per day to remain totally clean not in high school i wasnt the best natural athlete but i developed some skill in a few sport that never amounted to much i played basketball in middle school and always felt a disconnect to my for year ive been told that i look angry even when nothing is wrong understanding who i really am under my stoic and at time ostensibly angry exterior wa huge for my girlfriend winning me over it also helped that she could talk sport with me ive found that while guideline like this one are never

that i watch it of course we arnt the main character but it quite funny to i get antisocial this is not an istj at all period just saying this happens to me too i notice that alot of personality will come to ours with there problem and that can be because we are trustworthy to talk to or we are kinda the perfect im an istj female with a infp boyfriend and really the only problem area we have is to do with emotion i can come off a too harsh and cold and i sometimes see him a overdramatic and work eat sleep payday work eat payday work payday work money sleep die soul are hard to come by now a day ya know wink emotion i guess we are oblivious to how harsh we sound sometimes most of my family are feeler type we were raised in a very unhealthy dysfunctional enviroment my father is very manipulative and doe anything to get his way and my mother ha severe anger loyalty and frugality lol it true im and istj female my boyfriend is a infp he say he doe all the cry for me when im upset i just busy myself with alot of work and drown out any emotion i guess me getting hello im an istj female and my boyfriend is an infp my boyfriend can get really emotional sometimes because he think im being cold or im pushing him away i have no idea how to comfort him hello im an istj female and my boyfriend is an infp my boyfriend can get really emotional sometimes because he think im being cold or im pushing him away i have no idea how to comfort him i would have laughed to whether thats good or bad that is hilarious i dont think something like that ever happened to me though lolproud yes it amusing at time because i sound like sherlock holmes to other people o yes im super hard on myself i wa raised with an infp mother i did have to become aware that some of my comment were hurtful but all of them were neccessary and important so i had to word them differently i slip up quite ive always worked pretty good in a team atmosphere a long a we got the work done i always kept everything a a proffessional relationship whatever you have to do to get it done get it done it i like it shocked paint sculpt photography sketch watercolor all art basically dance learning culture and language video game ect ect enfp male have been hard for me to deal with they are a very fascinating group of people i dont think it a very good match very different group from u i cant cry in front of people just out of curiosity what is your intrest in istjs im the investigative type i must know xdkittehtonguekitteh curious about how much difference between istjs and isfjs in fashion sense happy do you like to wear a cap hate it what brand of running shoessneakers are your favorite a you guy are getting deeper in your relationship she becomes unsure im an istj female and i know in most relationship im hesitant to go to deep into because we wil basically be dedicating our we never needed to p i feel like this is important i read those word quite often but still i have no idea of what it truly is how do you know your unhealthy when you start messing with other people head doe if they cant hold a conversation i read that istjs view relationship a a necessary part of life and when they find someone they get attached to they make the commitment for life and dont really question it andor wont be the i dont know he kinda sound like he in between with a little bit of intj in himmabey he an intj ahemsweety you cant handle u even if you tried im the school secretary o yes and thing that we done to hurt people or failed to protect make u feel like shit not in the moment that it happened but when everything crash on u at once including people that hurt o and dont overdo it with embrace because then we feel your pity and really not tell you anything we dont like looking down upon it piss u off i am an istj i will try to answer how i wa able to deal with mine tell him if he need someone to talk too he can talk to you if he trust you he might tell you little thing here and there

we will eat your soul no if anything im the complete opposite in relationship no im too busy being independent for that i could care le what he doe never accused of being controlling but have been accused of being distant and emotionally unavailable istj party even though i hate partiesi would still like to meet all of you unfortunately yes but i have to be careful sometimes because it can really screw them up and change there life it a game to me yes but if the game get to big i have to cancel before i win to hahaha thats sweet we defiantly appreciated it google will take over the world one dayi do prefer the mastermind bathroom because it small hate the kitchen because there so much more to do i am defiantly not a feeler my infp mother would laugh at that i think it all

the character toaster infj in the very beginning of the movie i well this wa a very interesting exercise but unfortunately i couldnt use it at all to help determine my type i meanit asks you to describe why you feel the way you do and what made you decide intro you may skip if you wish so for year ive seen my brother a a fedominant type fe just describes him he is just so peoplecentric sentimental loving etc that it fit him am i weird in that i dont like the feeling alcohol give me i know a lot about who i am what i like and dislike what im feeling in the moment etc i just cant relate much to mbti surely it is not that strange to not be able to identify with such haha well part of the problem is that ni seems to defy explanation how can i relate it back to myself if it can only be defined in the most extreme abstract sense well im definitely not im not really sure where the sj traditionalist stereotype come from to be honest maybe kiersey only looked at elderly sjs oh and dont get me started on te being about organization sheesh yes and no yes because question in your post is highly indicative of no because that is the only thing we have to go off of so really i dont know enneagram seems to be about heh i am exactly actually what i mean isim far more apt to ask to help others than many people seem to be i would think this would be more of a fe thing see this is where hey there i have always felt that i have more sine than seni but i wonder if it just because people have such a hard time describing ni do you feel that you understand it perhaps you heh it funnywhen i first started learning about mbti i wa torn between istj and isfp i have entertained the idea of being a shy extravert but i have eventually rejected it i hate the do you want u all to fawn over you this sound more like a humble brag than anything i ha a sad now well and are more in line with stjs than sfjs specifically sits kind of in the background but will start acting like if no one is there to take the lead however if you said that you when i sneeze i clamp my nose and mouth shut so spit andor mucus doesnt get on anything it ha never stopped a sneeze im not really great at typing others but i just wanted to address this i really have no idea why people see the keyscognition test a the beallendall holy grail of cognitive function test hey guy so i saw the sticky saying that chat wa removed i remember it when i joined eon ago and it stink that it is gone however i wa wondering if the forumers here have an alternative are you saying that im either an sedom esp or sidom isj because im so positive on sensing or are you saying something else sorry im a bit confused hmmi will say that my view i got rluen which apparently correlate to istp however e v a t v f wa super close and u v o p v j wa somewhat close i feel like ive taken this before with the same work before play i do the opposite and it really terrible how much i procrastinate i cant see any downside unless youre a workaholicin which case i dont understand you at all p hi guy i joined this forum year ago and participated for a bit before dropping off the face of the planet in the short time i wa

(Although I do like reality TV such as Last comic standing and America's got Talent, which technically could be classified as talent search shows, not reality,...'",rant im hating being a night person right now ive been putting up with people crap at work for the past month in expectation of the lull after christmas and now that the initial hell is over i may complain but the truth is that i love it it a challenge but one that i can solve all i need is the time and patience perhaps but my version cost me nothing and get me up and running quicker since i dont have to wait on anyone else or on a package to be delivered rant heavy tech talk ahead so my computer had been acting up for quite some time and i kept barely managing the issue but today i got the bsod twice i wa so pissed i realized that my c you know youre a judger when in typing up your todo list for the next few day you start off by typing task down a they come to mind and then you spend time subdividing them into category i recently moved in with one of my cousin and one of her friend who if memory serf me right is an infp around of the time thing are good and all three of u get along but with my rave i get to go back to kearney next weekend for two friend wedding theyre marrying each other not two separate unique wedding this mean that ill get a chance to hang out with a lot of rave my inbox ha message in it now all i have to do is go through my individual folder develop a hierarchy delete useless email and not ever let my inbox get that way again now excuse i use gmail so space isnt a problem and this ha all accumulated from almost year most is archived in folder but my inbox is where i left the large bulk that i didnt have folder for sorry i havent been on much i moved about two hour away from home about three month ago and ive been trying to use this move a a catalyst to eliminate a lot of clutter from my life ive been rave i found out today that not only is one of my best friend just a cool fun guy to be around but apparently he also my third cousin were family that is awesome woman forgive me for this post or else dont read it but you know youre a male thinker when your female roommate come home call an apartment meeting and then proceeds to get emotional over rave put in an application at two different place on wednesday the one i most wanted called back yesterday and i checked back today and i have a phone interview tuesday morning rant im not i wa talking with my cousinroommate who dealing with a pretty bad breakup about my one failed attempt at dating and i explained the situation by comparing different people to shot glass and i just moved to a new town apart from work and shopping for necessity i have yet to do anything away from the apartment tomorrow is going to be my first nonwork nonshopping eventful day and you can tell what type of day im having by simply saying good morning or good afternoon to me if im having a good day ill say the same thing in return if my day been mediocre to just shy umm how would it rate on the price per item scale to get an individual one and a two pack that sound like a viable option to me i dont know if i mentioned it or not but my cousin who life in lincoln ha been looking into getting an apartment recently one finally opened up and im going to be the third roommate im when youre looking very seriously at moving about hour away from your current resident hell living space and you decide youre not going to tell anyone about it until you have more detail and im not terribly concerned with the phishing thing it wa more of a combination of the stress of all of that being thrown at me at once and kicking myself for making a mistake that im far too rant so today didnt start off bad not by a long shot but on the last two hour stretch of my shift they started to really f with me excuse my censored french but right now im pretty lucky the idea had potential the movie didnt scream trying to decide if one of my story is a little too close to it it not when youre having issue with your internet not connecting so you disconnect from your network on your computer and then reconnect restart your computer uninstall your wireless im willing to play from time to time how do you all coordinate playing time that wa exactly what i meant ive been on this site for a while now but i still cant remember any reference to this type of stuff then again i havent really ventured into the enneagram side and where do you get this info from exactly breaking dawn part overhyped cliched and formulaic it twilight i didnt expect much a clockwork orange odd so very odd cheyenne thats where my brother life rave i think well i more or le decided today that im going to move out to wyoming and live with my brother im scared and i have a lot to do in order to get it all done in time but im i think most place strive for quantity over quality bag that wouldnt rip a easily would require thicker plastic and reinforced seam and handle this mean that for the size of box that a couple of day ago at work i wa just going along kind of zoned out and a customer said thanks for doublebagging these i looked up and saw the bag she wa holding and honestly i could yep im glad im a guy i go in tell them to do what they want with it pay the bill and leave if they start a conversation i respond to the question with the bare minimum but dont dig when on the day of your first child birth a friend of yours give you a baby sign language kit a a gift and you say something to the effect of we were already planning on teaching him to be im a sensor and i find the concept of stuff like that repugnant i may be the exception here but i think that might be more of feeler thing when i talk to some of my friend i have been told that i intimidate them because they just know that im smarter than they are and i think well if i wa always hanging out with people i when someone who ha been where you work longer than you ha to ask you question when she ha one whenever i call my mom she always end it with i love you before we hang up i hate it because im stuck with three option i love you too thanks or yep bye two out of the three people like me at work because of this people hate me at work because of this it a vicious circle just to be clear i wa being sarcastic sorry for any confusion i just did a hour shift today and will probably follow it up with a hour shift tomorrow that start at am and im online when i should be in bed im pretty sure there a thin line when you work hour in one day just to get the overtime and then decide you may do it again the next day pssh sleep sleep is for wimp when your cousin asks you how your birthday wa and you respond with subpar to approximately average when a feeler buddy asks you to proofread two paper he writing for a class and in one he is talking about objective truth and objective morality but using subjective statement to prove his let use the seinfeld idea and create an excuse rolladex when youre willing to wig out on a imaginary drum set head bang and just generally have a great time when a song you love come on and no one else is around to see when around a group of extrovert if one start being loud and seeking attention you slowly inch away until youre no longer around them when you talk about your brain like it a computer it shutting down it multitasking it running a bit slow today you wish you could force close some background process etc and if this rant at myself due to the thanksgiving weekend and black friday im running so low on sleep that today at work i wa on autopilot my brain checked out about the same time i clocked in i did a search and i couldnt find one of these thread which i think is odd so you know youre an extrovert when you go to walmart on black friday and stand in line for almost one man it feel like youre following me although i do like reality tv such a last comic standing and america got talent which technically could be classified a talent search show not reality

it can apply to really i see being a social type more a understanding social norm and what is right and wrong under society eye not so much socializing although social type do tend to be more social social type shameless thread promotion withdrawn is more of having a wall between yourself and others typically unintentionally that is just impossible for you to cross with random stranger or even with oh no i can feel my distaste for sj stereotype rising but ill refrain the main reason i hate those so much is because i dont relate to them at all and i know that sometimes people see istj next at first i wa offended but then i thought about it and realized what you said wa pretty true i like being a for certain reason and i dislike being a for certain reason i dont think i have a question

hell yes physic and chem yes too the cf result point to you being infp buy when high sell when low thats the way to go bill you can get an it degree online in australia anyway commerce too i think i am of chaos from beyond the universe d rluei would correspond to intp a i see it you may a well take the big type a the cogntive function type though keeping in mind that you will get some out of sync result big add neuroticism but wth is that and how my type ha on average a higher iq than most other type therefore fuck equality bro my type is pretty crappy so damn common the goodside is being part of the s majority but being so introverted im isolated from that anyway though i do like being an irrational even if i am i prefer to focus on the introverted function rather than the extroverted function using myself a an anchor so you have the synthetic world of pi ready for forward action and the analytic world from what i know about type statistic it seems intj or isfj would be preferrable though without knowing about type i probably wouldnt have known or desired intuition hell when deciding if i what do you mean by extroverted counterpart estj is the extroverted version estp is the ideal partner this would be a very rare relationship given how rare infj is and infj with enfp is much more compatible but it is not incompatible this is in my opinion an ideal relationship dynamic same based on those point all pointed towards intj even the cf test mirror mine which go si ti te rest i think because the judgment function is le well differentiated but still for a qualitative rather than quantitative determination of whether your dominant is ti or ne check this post omg this pod people shit is ridiculous and everywhere and wont go away like fucking glitter im a naixyy apparently nife my facial expression are xyy no matter how much it seems like an for intp v entp or istp v estp decide which of the following pair of ti description applies best to you from my test result were others so if not w im probably w interestingly the result make me look very secure if a and very stressed if a look outside no i dont interact with estj istp intj entp intp entj you should automatically start teing more than usual also do stuff while raising your forehead i just did that and straight away noticed i think im a si is described a pessimistic but is described a optimistic so there a contradiction there te is competitive but a wouldnt be and i never really described myself a an nfj beat me up yesterday for not enthusiastically clapping my hand while saying i wa happy dayum gurrl u cray i dont even fuckin know aye everyone us all function personality is just a piece of the person soul neednt be taken in any religious sense what type is the author

seriously find someone who is a gentleman this guy is immature and is just playing around with people feeling i say stick him in the friend zone on the other hand i dont like starting conversation with stranger lately ive noticed stranger talking to me first though i default a an extrovert i dont find it necessary to talk to im sure this go beyond personality and there most likely more to her story a to why she bahavesed that way anyone can have an angry disposition regardless of their personality zombie youre one of my faves on perc see youre an esfj and i dont dislike you for the most part esfjs are peacemaker so we will default to the most practical and efficient way of im really bummed my post look like that and when i tried to edit it it wouldnt save it i gave up sorry hunny thanks for the invite hunnybunnynbsp ive read all the post and feel caught up between you and zombie and thequirkygirl who is ironically a dude who is former militarybrmuch like zombie i do im back and here are my result first i just want to say that i do not write like a year old writing with a mouse with my nondominant hand is not easy second by telling me how to think hahahahahahahaaa this esfj is on time for everything else except for this and work jk jk ive had a full weekendweek of being outside and such and wasnt able to sit in front of the a an esfj i dont actually mind the i and t part what im challenged with are the n and p i can deal and understand p i can lean towards that when my j game isnt on the n is a toughy let me respond second on a firsthand perspective personally speaking what kind of career are they drawn to i cant speak for all esfjs but i am drawn to management right nowbecause sound like an enfp i know it may not just be exclusively esfjs i think this whole thing is fascinatingin my experience what i dont like is how people use it for evil and not for good by good i mean using the knowledge of other personality to wassup wassup let do this interacting thing a an esfj i do not do well with confrontation the f get in the way more than i like for it to however we are quick to observe and quick to vocalize those observation sometimes it can come question whats ne mean im not too familiar with these i think i scored lowest on that one yes we sensefeel thing thats not usual and we want to do something about it thats all i like a lot of what other esfjs have suggested gentleness thats the key for anyone really zombie touched a little bit on this but i want to expand just a wee bit more perhaps it interestingly enough even though im a strong j when it come to my art project i dont necessarily finish them unless there a deadline but yeah i also start to read a couple book at a i find sjs to be really really critical im an sfj so i know but do my criticism require immediate vocalization not always lately ive been preferring for other people to learn from their i only drive if i have to i really prefer not driving but to answer

say it not quite right maybe this is where i stray from the typical istj but i do not care for gender role and expectation i see no point in trying to be something or someone i am not this time ive told every one of my girlfriend past and present that im not a going out and partying type of person i tell them to go out and do their thing ill be right here when you get my whole life ha been like that but even a a child i didnt care i wa never interested in all the thing girl were doing from then to now my best friend have always been guy many time i will definitely be reading up on this i like to prepared for whatever i have no problem with any of that lol whats really funny is that winter is her favorite time of year she love again thank you everyone for all of your advice i texted her in the late morning just to say that id be more than happy to keep her company when she walk through our city talking to potential these were all text i had thought it could be her phone or my network there have been time were she didnt receive my text until an hour after i sent it it never taken hour though a for one step forward two step back i wa out of town from thursday to monday i tried to keep our contact just like it wa when i wa at home i only contacted her around pm on thursday she had a cheesy a it sound im the lucky one i just dont want to screw it up thanks again everyone for helping me make sense of what wasis going on my past relationship were with woman who wanted me to be psychic and when i failed they would get pissed i know my current i see what you are saying it is hard for me to say what i want to say im afraid it will come off a sounding trite and just make her shut me out even more well im gon na be away for day so we live on the east coast of the u so yeah summer wa ending and thats why i posted this i want to give her what she need without her having to think about it since i lack that whole ive never pushed for anything i only got a close a she requested i know she ha no problem telling me when she doesnt like or want something she doesnt do anything just to humor me if she i would never tell a depressed person that they might be

opportunity for me to spend my after hour reflecting on my current goal and plan and making any adjustment havent dear friend all good thing must come to an end the sun is setting on my stay with this group a i look to what lie in the future i feel a yearning once again for adventure any plan to dear old friend it pain me to say this but i unfortunately will be ducking out of your upcoming birthday party with a fake excuse im sorry i really am but a a working guy i just dont have you ever had a feeling that life wa sort of just passing you by with very little you could do about it because thats what im feeling today like i have little control over anything and that mood a bit anxious hanging out with large group of people many whom ive never met before ha never been an easy affair but it something id best get used to if it not friend family and the world telling me i need to stop being a coward it my own subconscious mind reminding me of the lesson of the past a brief trip down memory lane tonight within this past week alone everything from my meeting with really successful people about my age and even random incident upon hindsight have been reminding me i need to move on and choose a path come again dear person you know who you are you guy need to stop elevating me a some kind of divine cool guy figure it true ive done thing that have helped the group out but the focus really need if there one cold hard truth ive had to accept it that i cant expect to be able to connect with and befriend every single person i identify a being cool and friendly it suck but it dear person this is the second time weve run into each other at our group social and i must say im not disappointed to say in the least even though weve spoken with each other just a couple shortterm fad but still i find it quite fun in my experience it been le about the game and more about just running into people and sharing in the joy of exploring while catching pokemon rant of the day cant wait for the weekend this week is really testing my patience for a plethora of reason ive accepted i cant control the chaos that come about but itd be nice having a dear person i think youve gotten me wrong another person in our community ha suggested that you think i have some kind of strange crush on you yeah no youre wrong and if youre going to dear person thank god you werent there at today gettogether man how thing have changed between u when we started running into each other you were that girl i always looked forward to rant of the day im having mixed feeling about this circle of friend ive been with for a few year i thought for a while maybe i wa going through a funk or that i wa just out of touch but vent of the day i have to remind myself that the good day are often easy come easy go there are time when i feel im really in the zone im tackling every challenge in front of me and my quality of life ha improved over the past couple of month i do martial art and i hang out once in a while with this group that meet up once in a while for random fun in my area and ive been rant of the day i thought that a certain acquaintence could become a good friend he and i started off on really friendly term even fit into one of my group very well early on but lately so there a devil even in infp angel shocked i feel you there even this istj ha regretted showing his more cold calculating side absolutely nothing upright and morally driven about it nah just a typical drama youve an infp being crushed on and then an influential figure within our circle who creating trouble for the group and then there me a reluctant rebel come to dear infp the card are all falling into place i have gathered a contingent of loyal follower whore ready to break off from our group and form a separate faction our own i have already had a funny moment today while walking to the restroom a door knob got caught on my shirt and created an inchlong tear after a brief moment of assessing the damage and feeling frustrated i dear infp im glad to see youre settled into our group and that youve become a core member that wa something i wa hoping for when you first joined but ala it doe sadden me to know that been going to this weekly meditation group for a few week now using this a an opportunity to grapple with a couple of personal issue that have lingered around for year i think i can say it we get a bad rap for being rigid but in this case it about principle and being very cautious ive decided i can never be too careful and this dang feeler in this case is a suspected infp were out there and were quite common we just prefer being outside the limelight you infps are known to be even more reclusive than u so it would actually require you to not only step out of dear intj you say people are questioning my intention i understand you said this out in the open a a half joke but knowing you it wa also an accidental cue to me that a small clique in thing i need to get off my damn chest dear estj i havent been completely honest about my past and im thankful you havent used your authority to look more closely into my file imagine it a tough journey reassembling the piece of the thing that is my life redefining who i want to become and finding satisfaction with what i have right now i keep telling myself that i am the dear infp im relieved to finally be seeing my feeling for you go away im not feeling nearly a much of the pent up resentment from not having what i desire or the occasional moment of not too far off the mark ive come to accept that you lot tend to have very creative mind certainly doe make for some interesting discussion topic strength of a fellow introvert op you need to give u more this is a relatively le known forum so you can probably give u more detail and leave out name without the fear of having someone irl discover this thread the dear infp damn it took me a while but i finally got over my incessant crush for you youll probably never realize the extreme measure i took to make it happen i made an extra effort to go out hardly anything beautiful in someone el emotional pain and yes i had to get it off my chest what hurt a bit is when she still seems a bit curious about me even with all these other guy dear infp if it look like im somewhat distancing myself from possibly even doing subtle thing to avoid you youre not wrong in your guess because thats exactly whats happening before i did it i found my conscience screaming out at me when my group leader tried to get me to enforce a very very bad rule on the group i told my leader i couldnt in good conscience do it and asked the realist say you dont you throw yourself into other activity and stay busy you focus on getting to know more people along the way and discovering there a bigger world beyond that one im fine most day it seems like a long a im keeping busy im fine and dandy but there are just some day where the weightiness of my situation feel like it too much to bear it a mixture yep like an angel or angelic is how ive seen people here and on other forum board describe infps i dont consider that a bad thing by any stretch of imagination if anything that make you rant of the day after month of weighing the pro and con and thinking thing over carefully ive finally decided to leave the group for good and on good term no drama involved just a rising op what you are saying sound exactly like how im feeling about another community im a part of and am making plan to leave it at some point probably best to leave out the personal deets in the

say striverbeliever the vals framework your primary vals type is striver and your secondary type is believer the primary vals type represents your dominant approach to life the secondary look for the taciturn people that dont speak unless spoken to or with a crowd of people they are familiar with with my friend you may think me an extrovert x you probably dont see u because i am always crossing my arm they dont feel comfortable at my side most of the time and i dont know what to do with them i use to stick my hand in my pocket and that made me feel at ease but hmm could it be that introvert use our time alone to recharge and you are fully energized everyone need to socialize a human are social creature but introvert take it in smaller burst my it doesnt really matter to me i am grateful for whatever i get i like to give more than get s i saw scott pilgrim v the world yesterday that wa good i like any movie with micheal cera lol wow i must have been half asleep when i wrote that because i mention her without saying who her is it my little sister lol better is a subjective view p i feel good because i wa able to get concert ticket for a concert near her birthday for her birthday present will be both our first time going to a concert because i avoid large crowd like the sorry to hear it his loss adamdorman is this istj p the temperament pattern you rated higheststabilizerchartthecourse the temperament pattern you rated secondtheorist behindthescene welcome come make yourself at home in the istj forum p wish i could thank that time p i am very good at ignoring people staring at me i just think in the back of my mind i wonder why they are doing that is there something on me but i will play it off like nothing is different yea i am pretty good at remember what story i have told people and dislike repeating myself however i will reference what story i have told this usually begin with like i have said i feel good because i just finished another book enders game wa really good p so back to the music here is a sample of what i listen to youtube just a random song on he indie playlist that i happened to like let get the thread what i like to hear most of all are thing that compliment what i have done and not anything really about me eg i set up a date for me and all my friend to go bowling some live far away at best i would say it resembles some just the perfectionist istj trait what i wouldnt say is that it resembles stoic ni or petal of stone i hate being put into a box based on type yes hehe i frequent border book store way more than the library p i recently read the book tuesday with morrie if you dont know the book is essentially about mitch alboms experience with his college professor who is dying of al al or lou gerhigs disease i guess i kinda used my hour up last night by staying up an hour later than normal i work at six am have to be up at five am so i usually am in bed at ten i drove my sister around for the hour doe everyone else here have no problem remember the lyric of the song they listen too if i listen to a song maybe two or three time i know all the word by heart so to speak even if i dont

you find people i dont think you can really force an istj into any activity he must have already noticed what youre doing since were so observant so getting his attention will not be a problem he just i often ponder about what life contains a im so intrapersonal but not so much about the bigger picture thats more occasional i can be controlling but im also quite perceptive if i do want my

is more fe than te so i will say she is possibly isfj most people in this thread have said they believe blair is exfj am i the only one who belief she could be istj she take such pride in her tradition eg her family on thanksgiving and serena at interesting how you all said infj a i thought he wa an extrovert for sure laughing id have said enfj instead although i see more ti than se i cant see him a ni dom though so yeah i see what youre saying with veronica especially when you compare her to someone like fiona in s or frank but i just dont see aux ni at all do you think she loop tese a bit dicaprio seemed a lot more esfp in his early day now he seems a lot more serious te but thats probably just him maturing hardy is istp for sure imo i agree with these enneagram yeah the joker didnt really seem like the joker a in previous incarnation like he didnt feel crazymenacing enough to me after all we heard about leto supposedly amazing method portrayal i monica not really sure of her type her bipolar make it hard for me ian i agree with estp from what arrow said but yeah he also tough for me because of his mental illness mandy esfj i i agree with you about inferior fi so yeah entj make the most sense also i never thought of that but she and katherine are actually pretty similar mindblown lol that make sense i can see her being entj with all the planning she doe combined with se to adapt to what happens with the liar but then i can see fe in her enjoying the game and her noel khan to me seems like a typical bad boy estp charlotte i have no idea but i guess a feeling dominant what make you think te dom ive also only seen the movie haha tom ripley he very hard to figure out but ill go with istp he very cold and calculating and think quickly in a crisis and ha unhealthy inferior fe with i definitely wouldnt have said cage wa fe i could see that i always saw her a esfp so entj would just be the same function in another order she could be playing up her lower function for the public i can see fe in her where do you see se keegan is very emotional but i wouldnt have thought he wa fe a he usually pretty quiet so for him id say isfp ian harding i agree is fe maybe esfj he could be enfj a well but he indeed cant wait to see her take cersei down next season even though i love cersei a well thanks for your explanation on jlaw though i see what you mean about how esfjs might be a bit le jonathanlivingstonseagulll what make you think aux ni though i can see fe dom and se tert but i have trouble seeing her a enfj because of her ni or my perceived lack

if im correct in believing so or if i am actually something personally i feel rather content with entj but due to the fact that my life wa before not too long ago a tremendous mess meaning big change have happened since which ha probably subconsciously so this wonderful show just recently started on abc and i wa wondering whether anyone had any guess already for what the character type might be if so please do tell my guess wes thanks for the help hearing from somebody else that entj fit the bill seemed to be the one thing i needed in order to make it official plus it a great type i have no doubt that i will grow have your interest broadened or narrowed over time honestly i think theyve narrowed down a bit i used to be all over the place with interest and not really going in deep into subject but first off id like to state that for some time ive considered myself to be an intp but a ive come to a new school and found myself being more social than reserved which is unlike before ive well im not completely sure what their type are but i have my guess father entp mother isfp brother esfp brother esfj brother entj being an intp doesnt automatically mean youre a coldhearted beast it merely mean your natural state of mind when making decision is thinking logically without any particular emotional hmm tough question but i guess mine would be something along the line of warehouse

intuition neni function meanwhile se and fe are always way nope unfortunately the primary part from both side apply oh trust me ive read through profile alright the intj one being very reasonable and fitting just a the intp profile is i am definitely most certain of my thinking trait objectivity is well thats the thing im not quite sure whether or not what i see in intp description are completely accurate for me at this point i can not discern between what i actually relate to and view yet no one ha given me any kind of insight how disappointing in the mean time i will settle with intp i can always describe myself via other mean re slytherin the while ive been content with the intp personality type for quite some time with an occasional identitycrisis about whether or not the type fit me enough i am beginning to question whether or not not sure if anyone ha mentioned it yet but claudia donovan from warehouse is most definitely an entp perhaps one of the more introverted one but all the same honestly cant think of anyone a comprehensive list maximilien de robespierre william shakespeare jrr tolkien albert einstein ada lovelace aristotle v for vendetta one hell of a movie tbh

short it wa kind of my first step i might make a longer video in the future if a thank you mean a lot and yeah i had to freshen up my avatar wink spontaniously made this video and i feel sorry for my english teacher however this is how i look like youtube when you made me think about it i actually had kind of the same feeling once it wa one night when i couldnt sleep i went for a walk through the neighbourhood with my dog for some strange reason if you have a talent and a passion i say go for it i believe one of the best way to learn about yourself is to live through your passion and interest not only will you be best at what you do my girlfriend is an infj and she wa just like that when i met her i actually had a really hard time the first year we were together because of it laughing then again i had a jelousy problem how much sleep do you need sleep cycle stage lack of sleep getting the hour you need according to this site the avarage sleep need are about hour for teen and preteen hmm i must definately read up on that though the perfect amount of sleep seems to be the kind of thing scientist have different opinion on lollaughing i tend to work both daytime and ive been with my

night and i tend to remember them the next day i also occasionally experience lucid dreaming not quite inception style but still an ounce of control i unfortunately it not physically possible for me to be there in time since i live in oslo laughing i would probably not be there if i could either mostly because of the reason mentioned i usually sit on the side during test ive experienced that i often want to deliver the paper a fast a possible which make my rechecking a bit hasty the thing is that most of the test room i must admit my taste in music doesnt change with the mood adept killswitch engage opeth dream theater pendulum and the list go onhappy any of you seen breaking bad i find it amazingly good other favourite are the big bang theory scrub family guy and ncis

after i found out about mbti personally i cant stand people who form their personality from their mbti result and not the other way around hence im id run to the other side of the world with raidbows shooting out of my behind ive been told that i look like brad pitt in his younger day you know with the ab and allhappy on a serious note no i havent been told that i look like anyone famous guess im unique im wink currently im taking a year off school before i continue my education mainly it is to wait for my girlfriend to get done with her education so that we can move in together and study

come to a decision once i have all the info and i decide if i learn from it and get over it if it on my end if it on her end im not wasting my time on her baggage ive got more important thing to do with my precious time and energy dude youre a horrible friend you need to hang out with asshole like yourself nobody want to be around someone like you and a quick apology solves nothing how distasteful excellent post thank you either it work or it doesnt why please explain what the hell on a scale of are you still talking oh thats not the point what is the point then thats what i thought istjs can be horrible or excellent communicator but a shy istj doesnt say enough a cocky istj is supersarcastic an angry istjs word can sting worse than a nailinthefoot i am a jaguar not a wolf my hypothesis is no your jobcareer doe not reflect your personality however how you feel about the job and how well it worksdoesnt work is definitely a reflection how you go about we are istjs were dutyfulfillers investigator and problem solver when there are problem to be solved we seem like workaholic when there are no problem we seem lazy or we start i just started a relationship with an istj girl and i am istj first of all i love it so far im used to enfp and infp so this is a real relief regarding affection shes so closed off if i a an istj i am very selective about who i get close to but also we read people very well and some people are terrified to be judged so that naturally scare people off im definitely oh no please stand by your statement if you only talk and dont listen you only learn what you already know wa interesting to see thanks hear hear job i enjoyed teaching tech support quality control file clerk job i despised waiting table let get a great idea of what careersjobs work well for u and which one we just dont fit into ive read article and list but i want to hear from real people experience let for sex yes for longterm trust and plan no we are dutyfulfillers so we accomplish a lot that go unnoticed so appreciation is priceless ask u question we have a vast storage of useful knowledge just waiting for someone to show how much is in the glass whats in the glass how large is the glass compared to the volume of it content what kind of glass is it how did the content get into the glass and what happens this seems to be the case with my new istj girlfriend shes opening up more and more and we havent cuddled yet but she say she really want to i can tell by the way she hold my hand and sure i wa tempted to quit the video after it started but i like a good challenge sometimes while the person posting the video apparently ha some selfesteem issue that we cant accurately ive found it interesting how istjs have responded to the threat of having the ugly gene i see a lot of rationalizing going on which while is typical of istj i wa expecting to see more i agree physical attractiveness can be subjective there no doubt about that it can also be scientific and there no doubt about that either i think it a matter of how according to a an istj were known to be very loyal and to the extent of personal sacrifice how do you handle making boundary and feeling like youre not abandoning your post and being selfish move your ive had enough relationship experience to be considered an expert at this point we istjs must have good communication i mean excellent if youre not getting this with her now youll want it guilty i know in my experience im often told that im handsome but never by woman im interested in woman im interested in look at me like im gross or there something wrong with me or honesty can hurt rudeness come from intentional disharmony or neglect if one speaks the truth in order to make an improvement i dont see how that could be generally considered rude although a so there a video on youtube pretty easy to find of a bluehaired chick claiming that istjs have the ugly gene id like to hear what everyone else ha to say about that ill be honest also regarding priority the habit of highly effective people by stephen covey esp the chapter put first thing first and lead the field by earl nightingale well i cant now that i read the previous post it look like im not the only one who notice happy researching dave ramsey financial peace best book on financial stability ever written that im aware of he doe a radio show too maybe it air in your area but the book is what you need im sure there okay that make more sense thanks immature istjs can be very manipulative especially when they dont have the confidence to communicate he could be upset about something and if thats the im very passionate and very sensitive however i feel a if i have complete control over my emotion if im sad i know i could change it but if something sad just happened i want to feel i am istj i attract enfp naturally and more easily than other type in fact all of my serious relationship have been with enfp or infp with enfp and infp the relationship is strong and sorry that doesnt make sense can you please rephrase hobby reading although i do it mostly with audio martial art computer studying various subject particularly those applicable to lifemy life psychology sociology philosophy thats hilarious i did consider that but thought i made it obvious enough in context thanks for pointing that out lol were staying in touch im going to see her again but im not sure how i am istj and i consistently attract enfps and im sick of it yes attraction is bangin in the beginning and i can think of sooo many reason why but when it come to living and functioning i am istj i recently met an istj girl online and that would make her the first for me even a a friend we went out on one date yesterday and

found out that they may never be when looking at occupation that our personality type will be successful usually job that require a lot of people interaction empathy and strong socialemotional skill arent high up on the when i first started dating my intj for an entire month and a half we were sort of in this weird phase where we were both excluaively dating one another however no word were spoken about it im not an intj but i am with one and he claim our relationship is the best he ever had and he the happiest he ever been with me im an istj if you dont make goal that are concrete how can you work towards them then improving your life doesnt just happen you have to have a plan to get to an end result you desire perhaps this is ive read many thing saying that intuitives often have

capitalist lackey the world would be better off if more people followed your ecological way however you need to change your avatar the space craft clash with your anarchoprimitivism message the space shuttle amen brother it really is the only way to move on it funny that it such a hard thing to do sometimes though social faux pa are a breeze for me to overcome but some early career mistake mercer what the others have said is right own your mistake but dont dwell on the negative stuff remember you are an istj not an isfj think about it are you better off getting emotionally cordiintj whats a unithest and yes you do sound a little depressed but thats not surprising since your dad sound like a jerk hellokittykat i think ni and darkest have spelled it out for you your situation doesnt seem to hold a lot of promise for whatever reason this guy doesnt seem to want to give you anything hey functianalyst i see what you mean about the type fad i dont see much of that im new and have spent almost of my time with my follow istjs most of whom dont seem that way to me list if you assume that type is not genetic the only thing that follows is that it is a factor of your environment it also obvious that we can not readily change our type sorry i dont yes i agree our feeling are what motivate u to do what we do oh yes ive been there the drive for perfection can have it downside interesting im not alone id like to go with the flow a little myself and no one ha ever called me boring to my face but ive certainly gotten that sense from some people it used to bug a no i dont speak french but i studied it in high school and i have some relative and friend who live in quebec so i get exposed to it every once in a while whether what he said in french wa johnny thanks for the video very funny whats strange is that i can only understand french spoken by an english transvestiteconfused thanks dude ive had a lot of positive feedback on the avatar i love it when people get it your dog seems pretty adorable and bearlike too and always happy when someone appreciates my humor wulfdot sorry i missed your input last night there seemed to be a deluge of response while i wa replying to some of the previous post two thing struck me about your post firstly your yes ive always thought so it true value lie in the time we spend in self evaluation and discovery it not a perfect label of who we are i get the should part a in a duty we that wa me in my teen and twenty nothing like a moon lit stroll through the deserted street im not a fascinated by the dark side of life a i wa i could look at it without emotion but i think that there is no doubt that the younger you are the easier it is to change and youre right a total personality overhaul is not very likely after i wrote the post i realized that this thanks for that distinction even though i know the proper definition of introvertextrovert i still tend to think of extroversion a being the same a being gregarious i can act very extroverted i support the death penalty for someone who commits murder or if they show clear intent that can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt and this would include anyone who plan to murder someone eg when i take a personality test i frequently second guess myself by thinking is that how i really am or is that how i would like to be sometimes it not that clear to me im an introvert i havent heard of the first two eddy izzard is fun i liked his show the rich i wa weened on monty python so dry sarcastic and irreverent british funny doe strike a chord with me i dont sunflower your thoughtful reply to all the contributor in this threat show that your heart is in the right place but your mind may not be maybe im just being too semantic but your phasing yes im a caterer too but not a much a i used to be it wa that whole non confrontational thing coupled with the introvert phobia of dealing with other people issue it just seemed a lot i cant say that i miss the old me part of me wa better i wa a little more carefree and part of me wa worse i wa more insecure about my ability a while back i read somewhere that if hi i dont mean to intrude but i just
